            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>THE first thing, here, to be considered, is the high and honourable Character of <hi>Paul;</hi> an Apostle, Messenger, or Ambassador of Christ. The matter of his Ambassy was the unsearchable riches of Christs Person, consisting in the fellow ship of the Mystery, or personal-union of divine and unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able righteous creature-natures or spirits, from everlasting; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9. This Mystery was not opened, till the Man Christ ascended into that Fellowship; <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. These things was <hi>Paul</hi> to declare, with the way and means, by which our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Christ, was translated out of the changable first-covenant-life of the Law, into unchangable union with his originally unchangable righteous creature-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and divine. He was likewise to declare, that the like death of Nature, in the highest restorations of the life and righteousness of the Law, lost by the Fall, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably necessary to any man's ascending into unchangable union with the man Christ, that by such death, ascended into such union with his own creature-root, and i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap>te divinity. This doctrine of the Cross on nature, at best, as altogether vanity, is to be preached by Gospel-ministers, in the most insinuating way and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful demonstration, so as to make it appear the unspeakable concern of those to whom sent, to comply with, and submit to the terms propounded from him that sends them. The Cross of Christ imports the crucifying, sacrincing-work of the everlasting and unchangable righteous new-creature-spirit of the Gospel (in which Christ is the true <hi>Melchisedec</hi> or high Priest of God) on the but changable righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous first-covenant-life of the Law, in the nature of Man or Angel, at best. The devil and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> angels did proudly and presumptuously set up for themselves in that fading life and glory they were possess'd of by the first creation (in a superiority to man) against the high Priest of God, and God himself. And soon was man in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to believe Satan▪s lye, that the Life he was possess'd of, by the first-creation, was eternal, which prevented his obedient submission to that death, which was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably to pass on the natural spirit of both, in order to their being saved. <hi>Ye shall not die at all.</hi> This is Satan's and Man's accursed other Gospel, that the first-covenant-life
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:206287:3"/> of their own nature, in their first-creation-make, is eternal, so no need of a second creation or covenant. As soon as man is restored by Christ, out of the corrupt fallen nature, into the rigbteous life of the Law, Satan is at his elbow with the self-same lying suggestion, as to <hi>Eve; Ye shall not surely dye.</hi> This is eternal Life. This work, <hi>Paul</hi> found him at, with the rich, full, first-covenant Kings, my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stical Princes of this World, such as crucified Christ for the Cross-Doctrine of the second; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 3. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 8. and 4. 8. All the wisdom, life, righteousness and glory, Angel or Man were set up in, by the first-creation, from the changable, fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding nature thereof, is charactered in Scripture, by the word, <hi>Flesh, Woman,</hi> and called <hi>Earthly,</hi> a glory to be done away. In distinction from, and superiority to this, the spiritual, gospel, new-creature-life of Christ, set up in man or angel, by a new creation of them, is called <hi>Spirit, Grace, Truth, Life,</hi> in an absolute sence, and charactered by the word <hi>Man,</hi> that never transgressed or could be deceived. No Female, nothing of a changable nature, in the new-creation-gospel-life of Christ. This Life brings with it, and comprehends in it the infallible Wisdom and everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Righteousness of God, the power of Godliness, Glory that excels, never to be done away. With this, the righteousness, wisdom, or glory; all, receiv'd by man or angel, in their first-creation, is admitted no comparison, but look'd on as a meer nullity, no glory, wisdom, life or righteousness at all; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10. A true Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-ministry then, layes the Axe to the root of all humane interest, preaches down nature by lump, in the righteous or corrupt state thereof, as altogether Vanity, a vanishing shadow, a perishing nothing (as to the final salvation of man or angel) at best or worst, or any intermediate condition. Had first-covenant-Life, or the first-creation-state of both, been faultless, or unliable to miscarriage, and no way deficient as to their eternal blessedness, there had been no need of, or room for a second; <hi>Heb.</hi> 8. 7. Those that confidently set up for salvation, in the but restor'd first-covenant-life of the Law, and righteousness of man, reigning as kings there, joyn directly with Satan in his temporary worldly spirit and kingdom, as <hi>Pseudo-fifth-Monarchists,</hi> in opposition to Christ's everlasting Kingdom, in the Spirit of the Gospel. An immortality of being, man and angel had in their first-creation, not of Life. That is brought to light by the Gospel, and set up in both, by a new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The first renew'd, is not the second. First-creation-life was old as soon as set up, or when it is a-fresh renew'd, by way of Redemption, as one fruit and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the death of it, in Christ's person; because from the beginning, subject to decay, wax old, and vanish away. Gospel, or New-creation-life, is ever new, to Eternity, always fresh, green and flourishing, unsubjected to decay, old age, or death. This is called, <hi>Newness of Life,</hi> in which alone men can bring forth fruits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. and 7. 4. the other, <hi>Oldness of letter;</hi> in the most righteous exercise whereof, man brings forth fruit but to himself <hi>(Hos.</hi> 10. 1.) for the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and adorning of his own nature; the visage or state whereof, Christ marr'd or destroy'd, in his own person, more than it can be marr▪d in any other man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause no other man has so much of it to marr. <hi>Newness of Life, Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liness, Righteousness of God, and Image of the Heavenly,</hi> is no otherwise attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:206287:3"/> than by the change of the old, with its form of godliness, wisdom, and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of man, in the image of the earthy, through the death and loss of all. All fading goodness in first-creation-life, is to be parted with, for what is unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the second. This Christ told the self-confident young man; <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 20-22. These terms did seem so hard to the evil Angels, at first, that in the clear sight of the more excellent new-creation-life and glory, shining in its own sun-beams upon them, they wilfully rejected it, and set up for themselves in the fading life they were possessed of in their natural make, by the first-creation. They knowing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected eternal-life, and chose eternal-death, out of self-love to the life of their own nature. Gospel-light only, secures no man or angel from the unpardonable sin against the Holy Ghost, or wilfull rejection of the new-creature-spirit of the Gospel. This being the case, and these the terms, propounded by Christ and his Gospel-messengers, for the salvation of men, what entertainment they are like to find in this world, is easie to imagine. They preach that, which many Angels, and all men, as included in their representative, would not bear at first; and which the very Disciples, whilst Christ was but a fleshly bridegroom with them, said, <hi>Who can bear?</hi> Satan endeavours might and main, to deaf all Ears to these spiritual char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers, charm they never so wisely. Their message renders them, with <hi>Jeremy, Men of contention with the whole Earth;</hi> All, in but the Life and principles of nature, corrupt or righteous, heathen, or a first-covenant people of God, that may again become no People. These, finding all that life and mystical riches, they rest confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in, for salvation, struck at, by the gospel doctrine of the Cross, have still bin the fierce, ring-leading Persecuters of the spiritual Saint. These were the mysti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Briars, Thorns, and Scorpions, <hi>Ezekiel</hi> prophesied amongst; <hi>Ezek:</hi> 2. 6. These both killed the Lord Jesus, and their own Prophets; persecuted his Apostles, pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not God, and were contrary to all men, the corrupt heathen on their left, and the spiritual Saint, on their right hand. By what usage, Christ (Gods Apostle or Messenger of his Covenant) found amongst men; men, that are his Apostles, may know what to expect. He came to his own People in the first, and they reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, contradicted and blasphemed all his doctrin of the second, and murdered him. <hi>The servant is not greater then his lord.</hi> Christ, the Fathers Apostle or sent one, is not greater than he that sent him: Nor are Christs Apostles so great as he that sends them. <hi>As thou hast sent me into the world, I have sent them.</hi> Thou hast made me thy Apostle. I have made them my Apostles. Neither I nor they are of the world, So the world hears not, or receives, but hates and rejects us and all our words. <hi>Jo.</hi> 15. 18,—20. and 17. 18.</p>
                  <q>By the commandment of God our Saviour, and Lord Jesus Christ, our Hope.</q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> was ordained an Apostle, by the appointment of God the Mediatour, in his divine and originally unchangable creature-spirit, and by the Lord Jesus Christ, as translated out of the changable righteous life of our nature, into the unchangable life of both. His divine set up his own creature-spirit of everlasting righteousness,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:206287:4"/> from everlasting, in unchangable union with it self; <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23. This was the creature original of Gospel-life or everlasting salvation, to angel or man, and of all right grounded hope in either, of ever seeing or enjoying the divine nature. In the most intimate marriage union, and personal conjunction of divine and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-natures or spirits, is Christ fitted to answer all that God requires, or creatures need for true blessedness. By Gods free choice and gift, a seed of this creature-spirit was cast into the immortal spirits of men, from the date of their radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal existence in him, the father of spirits. When personally existing in this world, this seed, quickened up by Christ, the spiritual seeds-man, into its proper life and motion, is his actual giving eternal life to as many as the Father has given hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. In and with this spiritual life, springs up a new unde<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>standing in men, by which they are enabled to see all things, not only spiritual, but divine also; <hi>The deep things of God.</hi> They see the whole mystery of godliness, the otherwise unknown riches of Christ, on the one hand, and the otherwise undiscernable depths, wiles and methods of Satan, in his whole mystery of Iniquity, on the other, managed by first-creation-vanities, against the infinite divine, and everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous new-creature-spirit of truth. When the whole counsell of God, and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery of godliness for the salvation of men, comes into the saints view, the whole counsel of the Devil, in his mystery of iniquity, for the damnation of men, flies open, also. They can bring up into open view, his deepest, most concealed designs and projects. The man Christ, translated by his own everlasting righteous-creature-spirit, out of the changable righteous life of the Law, into unchangable personal union with it self, and the divine, is the only suitable means to open and let down the said blessed life unto men, and thereby to give the clear and full knowledge of the mystery of God the Father, and of Christ. Thus, in our exalted nature, is the Lord Jesus, as united to, and fill'd with divine and everlasting righteous creature-Life, the immediate object of all true Saints Faith and Hope. The mystery of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and creature fellowship was hid, till ascended into, and opened by the Man Christ, our Hope; the certain hand and meanes of conveying the same gospel-life into men, that himself in our nature, is ascended into the full possession of. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Saints, before Christs coming in flesh, by a spiritual faith in that Gospel-life that is now brought into open view, were found in an indissoluble union therewith; and as spirits in prison or confinement, received their share in the opening of it, with saints in the body, under the Gospel-dispensation and day. Before this, it was a hidden mystery; <hi>Rom.</hi> 16 25, 26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9. The opening of this hidden my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterious fellowship of divine and everlasting righteous creature-nature, in Christ's wonderful person, was prophesied by Saints under the Law, to be enjoyed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:206287:5"/> disputes and writings, rendring them a meer mystical <hi>Babel?</hi> These all agree to build on the same sandy foundation, the restor'd righteousness of man, or life of the Law, by which to reach salvation, and climb up into heaven. But what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions of Language and Opinion are they found in, by the way, in carrying on their vain attempt? What skirmishings for and against Free-will in all men, for Salvation; neither of the Combatants owning any other Free-will than what all men lost by the first sin of the first? And this, all men may return into the exercise of, by that general deliverance out of the fall, amounting to the common Salvation. But, as to everlasting salvation, the loss of this freewill, and of all the fruits, or works of righteousnes, producible or performable therein, is undispensably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary. Never was ever-lasting life to be found in the first covenant state of man or angel, before the fall; and much lesse, since. For no restorations of it amount to the primitive personal purity in it. And in the highest restoration of it, by way of redemption, is filth of Spirit, that is, an enmity to God and his new-creature-spirit of grace, the original of all Gospel or eternall Life. All the mystical riches of man, heaped up in the most wary and fruitfull exercise of the restored righteous life of his own nature, will vanish, as well as his bodily life and literal riches, leaving him in darknes and death, to Eternity, under the wrath of God.

When men have resolutely engaged to build on the Sand, or changable principles and life of the Law, for everlasting Salvation, their fallible understandings, from the husk and letter of Scripture, run them into endless Disputes, and unutterable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions, charactred here, by <hi>Fables and endless Genealogies.</hi> Satan, in his superiour angelical wisdom of the first-creation-sort, can toss them up and down, into per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly contrary thoughts and perswasions, back'd with plausible appearances and probabilities, on all hands. The spirit of this world, in man or angel, is but a spirit of darkness, as to all things in the next. So, while man in the highest wisdom of his enlightened nature, is confidently undertaking at Gospel-matters, he acts but in a spirit of darkness, under the Prince of darkness, that will run him into snares, out of which he will never be able to disentangle himself, to his dying day.

First-covenant-life, set up in, for salvation, is mans Fable. This Fable runs him into a maze of unprofitable Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stions, Disputes, and Contentions, about he knows not what, instead of a right edifying, and building himself, and others up, in the faith and acknowledgement of Christ, in his Gospel-life of everlasting righteousness and truth. In this, only, true blessedness is to be found, which is the great want and secret desire of mans immortal spirit, however mistaken as to the very thing it self, eternal-life; and consequently, in the search after it, and all the ways and means of attaining it. He contends with God himself, about his salvation, and the way to it. He stands up, as <hi>pro aris &amp; focis,</hi> for defence of the life and liberty of his own nature and will, against the Gospel-spirit, or Cross of Christ, by which he comes to offer up all those frail, first-creation vanities, in sacrifice to God, as he served them in his own person.

Man strives, disputes, labours and contends all the dayes of his life, against God and his declared way of salvation, to his own eternal ruine. A sore travel. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion, does man come to experience, when too late, that he has been engaged, all along, in the fabulous gospel, or doctrine of devils, in stead of being edified, or edifying others in the faith of Christ.</p>

                  <p>The Law, in its various but most harmonious Testimonies, is fully answered by the truly Spiritual, Gospel-righteous man, who, in obedience to its own counsel, has delivered himself up into the hands of another Governour, the Gospel-spirit of Christ. The Law has nothing to do with, or say to, or against such a man. He is dead to it, as to that first-covenant-life, in which, for a season, it required active obedience. So, by passive obedience to it spiritual voice, in submitting to the death of that state, under the Gospel-spirit, is he lawfully discharged from performing any obedience to the Law, in the active power of that life. To continue to obey the Law, in that Life, when by the spiritual Testimony thereof, required to part with it, in order to live unto God, in his Gospel-spirit of everlasting-life, is rebellion against both Law and Gospel. And to cease from obeying it in the former life, in order to live unto God, in the latter, is the perfect fulfilling of the whole Law, in the spirit of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. The Law of God requires more than ever could be done by angel or man, in the active power of their first-creation-life▪ but, not more than can be done in that more excellent creature-life and way, which the Law it self, by its second voice, shews the necessity of parting with the other, for. When a man is possessed of a better life and righteousness than the Law has to give (but which it directs to Christ, for) he is fully discharged, acquitted and justified by that, also. He is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally justified by the spirit of the Law, spirit of the Gospel, and God himself, the infinite divine Spirit. No Light, Truth, or Law will accuse or condemn him, or has any thing to say against him. <hi>Against such, there is no Law;</hi> Gal. 5. 22. 23. So, the Law is not made for the Gospel-righteous man.</p>

In the corrupt spirit of nature, are men guilty of the sins here mentioned, in the gross, litteral sence of the words. In the restored, righteous spirit of nature, confidently rested in, and set up against the Gospel-spirit of Grace, do men become guilty of all sorts of spiritual, mystical abominations, called by the same names, of
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:206287:7"/> a more criminal and provoking nature, than the literal. Enmity to God and his Gospel-spirit, and so to the power of godliness therein, under the form of godliness and righteousness of man, is the root of all. A fixed self-love to their own nature, in the first-covenant-life of the Law, renders them unchangable enemies to God and the second. So, are they turned from a first-covenant people of God, into a Synagogue of Satan, in unchangable union of mind with him, who first set up the changable first-covenant-life and fading glory of his angelical nature, in unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enmity to God and the second. Thence-forward, are they found in the practice of all mystical whordoms, adulteries, idolatries, murders, thefts, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> in unchangable harmony of mind with the evil angels, against God, Christ, and all his Gospel-truths and Saints. They that give up themselves to the vile affections of the corrupt spirit of nature, with litteral <hi>Sodom,</hi> the vengeance of eternal fire is the meet recompence of their errour; <hi>Rom.</hi> 1 26, 27. <hi>Jude. vers.</hi> 7. And, to the same dreadful end, come all such first-covenant-saints or people of God, with their holy flesh, form of godliness, and righteousness of man, that set up there, for salvation, in unchangable enmity to the new-creature, gospel-spirit, power of godliness and righteousness of God. This turns the mystical earthly <hi>Jerusalem,</hi> into spiritual <hi>Sodom, Egypt,</hi> and <hi>Babylon.</hi> The three Witnesses, Law, Gospel, and God himself, that acquit and justify the spiritual righteous man, will accuse and condemn these, for ever. <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Law, which they reckon, justifies them in the Letter, by the spiritual voice of it, condemns them; and this, without any inconsistency of its vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous testimonies. So are they gone, every way. All light and truth is against them; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 45. The Law, in its accusing and condemning power, is made for both these sorts of lawless persons, that fix either in the corrupt or righteous state of their own nature, and so, in unchangable enmity to God and his Gospel-spirit of grace. But the lawless persons, chiefly here meant, are such, as by the lawful use of the righteous life of the Law, sin unpardonably against the Holy Ghost, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Gospel. So, fall they under just condemnation, from Law and Gospel, as not using the former, in obedience, but opposition to the latter. So are they law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less persons; against all Law, and all Law against them; both the Law they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend obedience to, and the Law of the Spirit of Life in Christ Jesus, and the infinite divine Mind or Law, which ought to be obeyed by all angels and men.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> here magnifies the grace of God, by shewing what sad circumstances he was in, immediately before his Gospel-conversion. He was eminent in the life of the Law, and remarkable in enmity to the life of the Gospel, in Christ and his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers. By Gospel-light he finds himself to be a blasphemer, persecutor and inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, in that very thing, wherein he, before, verily thought he had done God ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. He utterly denied the Gospel-spirit and words thereof. For this, he takes shame to himself, as of the highest rank of pardonable sinners against the Holy Ghost. But, to his unspeakable joy, the Lord bestowed, and he obtained that mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of our Lord Jesus Christ, unto eternal-life, he was fighting against. In the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est first-covenant-life and wisdom of man, he was in a total ignorance of all Gospel-matters and life. He was (in a sort) faithful to the light he had, when he perse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted the Gospel. Yet, in God's sight (and after, in his own also) he was therein, a Blasphemer, persecutor and injurious. He was judged faithful to his light, under the Law, and put into the ministry of the Gospel, he persecuted. He was imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately obedient to the heavenly Vision, as soon as Christ in his Gospel-light shin'd upon him, saying, <hi>Who art thou, Lord? What wilt thou have me to do?</hi> Act. 9. 5, 6. He presently owned Christ for his Lord, and engaged to obey his commands. So, was owned by Christ himself, to <hi>Ananias, As a chosen Vessel, to bear his Name, or preach his Gospel, to Gentils, Kings, and the Children of Israel;</hi> Vers. 15.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> here declares his own happy experience of Christ's comming into the World to save sinners. All man-kind are sinners, cast by the first sin, into a two-fold death; The <hi>first,</hi> by the losse of the changably righteous first-covenant life of their nature, wherein created. The <hi>second</hi> is found in the restored righteous Life of their nature, consisting in filth of spirit, or enmity of the natural spirit, at best, to the Gospel-spirit of Christ and righteousness of God, therein. <hi>Paul</hi> himself was a signal instance, for this, who in the renewed life of the Law, persecuted and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed the spirit of the Gospel, and all the words of its life and wisdom. All men, then, within the compass, and in the life of their own nature, corrupt or righteous, are concluded under sin, both <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentils,</hi> Heathens, or first-covenant Saints, with their holy flesh, under the dispensation of Law or Gospel; <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 9. <hi>All the World is guilty before God; v.</hi> 19. Neither circumcision or uncircumcision, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or corrupt nature availes any thing, but only the new-creature-life of the Gospel-spirit of Christ, in man, for salvation. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6. 15. No being in Christ, or owning of him, saving in his Gospel-life, is salvation. And this cannot be received by any, but through the death and abolition of the life of nature, which, in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever variety of condition, is found in enmity to it. Yea, in Christs example, we find, that were there neither actuall corruption, nor enmity, filth of flesh nor spirit in our nature, the life of it, as a changable thing, a fading flower, altogether vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, must, by a Law of invincible necessity, pass away, in order to our being possessed
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:206287:8"/> of the everlasting life of the gospel-spirit of Christ, into which he raised our nature in his own person. Of the whole rout of sinners, that are found in a twofold state of sin and death, in the corrupt or righteous life of nature, <hi>Paul,</hi> in the righteous life there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, declares himself the chief or greatest sinner, of all that stand capable of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy shewed him, having furiously expressed his enmity against the Gospel-spirit, in which alone, he or any can be saved. He breathed out threatnings and slaughter a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the professors of it, being excedingly mad against them; <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 1. and 26. 11.

                  <p>He farther magnifies the grace of God, over-ruling all his evil practice against the Gospel, not only for good to himself, but others also; and this, as one ground and cause of his obtaining mercy.

For this cause, was <hi>Paul,</hi> at the highest pitch of a pardonable Blasphemer and Sinner against the Holy Ghost, pardoned, and received into favour. Here is a fair Door of Hope, open, for Professors of Godliness, in the form thereof, righteousness of man, or first-covenant-life of the Law, though engaged in a mistaken zeal, against the Gospel.

Let men follow this pattern of Gods long-suffering, in his ready obedience to the Gospel-life and doctrine of Christ, as soon as convincingly made known to them, and all wil be well.

The Faith and good Conscience that may be Shipwrack'd and lost, import not Gospel-life, but light only, by the beaming forth of the new-creation-Sun of everlasting righteousness upon men, in which it shews and offers its life to them, and convincingly evidences the terms on which it can be received, the death of nature, at best. Such spiritual illumination is called a partaking of the holy Ghost, a tasting of the heavenly gift, good word of God, and powers of the world to come, which wilfully apostatiz'd from, lays men under an impossibility of recovery; sets them out of all distance, as to any more benefit of Christ's sacrifice, for ever; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4,—6. and 10. 26, 27. They see, hate, and enter into a combination with the Devil, to do despite to the spirit of Grace, after sanctified or clensed from filth of flesh; <hi>vers.</hi> 29. This willful sin against the Holy Ghost, leaves no place for repentance or change of mind. Yet are there pardonable degrees, in turning from such Gospel-faith, as spiritual light amounts unto, which is called, <hi>a beginning in the spirit.</hi> Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, the bewitch'd <hi>Galatians</hi> had not stood capable of recovery. Though through strength of temptation and weakness of flesh, they were frighted with the Gospel-doctrine and spirit, (that spoke nothing but fire, sword, cross, war and death to
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:206287:11"/> their holy flesh) and retreated into the cool shade of a worldly Church, that sooth'd them up with hopes of Salvation therein; Yet, were they capable, not only of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering the right exercise of their Gospel-light, but also, of having the birth of Christ's Gospel-life brought forth in them (through <hi>Paul</hi>'s farther Gospel-labour with them) that's absolute salvation; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 1,—3. and 4. 19. The closs, obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent following Gospel-light, till partakers of Gospel-life, compleates the Gospel-good-conscience towards God. So much, as to what the holding faith and a good Conscience is. <hi>Secondly,</hi> Then, what's the losing and ship-wracking one and the other? The putting away the good conscience, and shipwracking the Faith here meant, implies their having had both, that so do. Ye began in the spirit, and ran well, for a season, in a faithfulness to the light thereof, who did hinder or drive you back to a confidence in the flesh, that ye should not go on, in your well begun obedience to the spirit? <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 7. The light of the Faith of the Son of God, may, for a season, be followed, and then, finally, with the good conscience, attending such obedience to the Gospel-spirit, be ship-wrack'd and lost. The life of the faith of the Son of God can never be so apostatiz'd from. While Gospel-light is a super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural gift, superadded ornament, and advance to restor'd, enlightned nature, man is apt, from self-interest, to make much of it, own and profess it. But when the Gospel-cross or flaming-spiritual sword is discovered, and speaks death or aboliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on both to this Gospel-conviction-light, and the life of nature, at best, advanced thereby, as undispensably necessary to the partaking of and feeding on Christ's Gospel-life, and meats, this, when man is found boggling and startling at, so as to look back, Satan is ready at hand with all worldly allurements and witch-crafts, to chear and build him up in a direct enmity to all; and resolution, never to look that way more. The Gospel-spirit of Christ, is the Cross, or flaming Sword, that admits no passage for man to the Tree of Life, but by passing under it. This Sword both kills and sets fire on the spirit of man, at best, in order to translate it out of the death of its sacrificed nature, into the life of God's sacrificing High-Priest. They that own Christ, as the Apostle and High-Priest of their Profession <hi>(Heb.</hi> 3. 1.) should not refuse to give up themselves by his hand, in sacrifice to God. The Law-Priest sacrificed clean beasts, types of cleansed, righteous men. The Gospel-Priest sacrifices the cleansed spirits of such righteous men. If men turn from Gospel-light, when thereby brought to this fiery-tryal; away go God, Christ, Faith and good Conscience, all, that's in any sence, spiritually good, to welcome the Devil, with his worldly glories, and pleasing offers of perishing vanities. And thus comes the Vessel it self, mans immortal spirit, in which this sort of Gospel-faith and good conscience were, to be totally split, and ship-wrack'd, through his impetuous storms and temptations, on all hands; And so, the whole treasure once put into the said mystical Ship, lost, to the everlasting ruine thereof. Christ, in the all-power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full life of his Gospel-spirit, is the sure Anchor within the Vail, to which mans im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal spirit being firmly tied and fastened, by a union with him in the very life thereof, becomes unmovable under all storms and tempests of the evil one, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. 24, 25.</p>

But all he can do herein, is over-ruled by Christ, for the destruction of their flesh, that's his own party and salvation in Christs spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that, he cannot touch. To this end, by <hi>Paul</hi>'s order, in the Gospel-name, spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and power of Christ, was the incesiuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> delivered up to Satan; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 1,—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>. Such enlightened Gospel-saints, on their turning from Christ, delivered up to Satan, may possibly by his powerful influencing, and buffetings, be hurried into literal uncleannesses also, the gross abominations of the corrupt spirit of nature, for the marring and spoiling their holy flesh, the wrong way, by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness of man, not righteousness of God. But even such gross sins, can God over-rule the venom of, and make the recovered Saint, with <hi>David, Solomon</hi> and others (when reflecting on all, in the sanctuary light of Christs Gospel-spirit) to abhor their own nature at best, and resolutely part with the life thereof, which they find not fence-proof against such gross and detestable vilenesses, as expose them to censure from the restored light of reason, in all mankind. But, such as Satan finds to be his resolved faithful subjects, on their turning from Christ, he will pamper, fill, adorn, beautify, and advance them, with his superiour angelical first-creation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, in that first-covenant-life and righteousness of their inferiour humane nature, they have resolvedly turned to, in order to joyn with him in the unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able enmity thereof, to God and the second. As for the spiritual saint, that's at bottom, Christs willing subject, and Satans unwilling captive, tis the spirit of Christ, Satan strikes at, in him, but can hit nothing but flesh. So Christ makes all his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted buffetings of them, and insultings over them, exactly serviceable to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of love to them, by carrying on the work of his Cross, upon them, for their salvation, in direct contrariety to Satans design, for destroying them. In his buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of them, will he upbraid them with their disobedience, through his seducements
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:206287:12"/> to Christ, their true Lord and Husband; for which, their own Consciences reproach them, as sinners against his spiritual light, in them. By this means, he endeavours to bring them into such distraction and confusion, as from the seeming desperateness of their condition, utterly to abandon that light of Christ, as having sinned them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves out of all reach of his sacrifice, or hope of his favour. And then, to alleviate their sorrows, does he labour to gain them, in this confusion of mind, to listen to his offers of setting them up in the freedom, life, and glory of their own nature (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what they ever yet experienced) by his angelical communications; and as their only retreat into a quiet repose, requires them to give themselves wholly up, to his conduct, for ever. But Christ over-rules all these attempts of Satan, upon his true Saints, so as to extinguish his own party and interest in them, by his own hand; that carnal mind of enmity, that was the Blasphemer.</p>

                  <p>ALL men, without exception, are daily receivers of good from God, in one kind or other, for which, thanks are to be paid to God, by saints, on their behalf, and by themselves, too; <hi>Act.</hi> 14. 17. God causes his Sun to rise, and Rain to fall on the evil and on the good, just and unjust; <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 45. Christ, a twofold mystical Sun and fountain of Waters, shines forth more or less, on the spirits of all men, for the lightning every man that comes into the world, with na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural or spiritual, first or second covenant-light, and causes his rain to fall on all, for the rendring the mystical earth of their nature, fruitful in works of righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, of one sort or other, if the fault be not in themselves. All this is figured out, by the litteral Rain and Sun. Any degree of first-covenant-light, or restored ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal light of nature, in man, directs and leads him towards a first-covenant-life, and righteousnes of man. This light is the law of nature in all mankind, excusing or accusing them, accordingly as they comply with, or rebel against it. And their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conscience is rendred good or evil, by doing what they know is good, or evil. This first-covenant-light of the Law, in all mankind, is able to discover to man, and convince him, that there is no safe standing for him, as to true blessedness, in that life of his own nature. For that, at best, was lost by all men, in and with the first. And, in every mans experience, does not secure from such common sins, as lay them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der just reproof and condemnation, from the very law of nature, or common light of reason in themselves and all other men. So then, more or less, all men are under something of conviction, that no such thing as true blessedness or eternal-life is ever to be found or had in that life of their own nature, corrupt or righteous, which evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:206287:12"/> it self to every mans experience, to be a fading flower. Now, for these ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral benefits, provided for all men, are true Saints to pay thanks to God, and pray for all mens willing receiving and right improving of, for their good. And they ought also, to make their supplications, prayers, and intercessions, on the behalf of all men, as to what they yet stand greatly in need of (when actual partakers of all the common and general benefits of Christs death) even that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er good and mercy, than either they had or lost in their first parents, a spiritual and everlasting righteous life, the Gospel Pearl, the unspeakable gift.</p>

                  <p>1. Who are these Kings and men in Authority? 2. For what end are Saints to put up their prayers with thanksgiving, on their behalf? To the first, Kings and those in Authority, are such as are set up, either in a civil or religious capacity, to exercise visible rule over others, whether men or saints. For them, as such, tis the true saints duty, to pray, that the Lord would bestow upon them, his spirit of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting righteousness, which alone can teach and effectually enable them, rightly to discharge their place and duty, in either of the said Governments, they exercise over them. For, he that ruleth over men, must be just, ruling in the fear of God; 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 23. 3. No man is compleatly qualified for ruling over men, but in Christs Gospel-spirit it of everlasting righteousness. This only can teach men the right order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of their steps, in the government of themselves or others. Those words in <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel,</hi> do chiefly relate to the Man Christ, himself, as a prophecy of what he shall be seen to be, at his second coming, in his Fountain creature-spirit of everlasting righteousness, as fully accomplished to rule over all, and fulfil the whole will of God, therein. By partaking of this spirit only, can Rulers over men, in Church or State, truly answer their high Place and Office, by a right encouraging of all good works and workers, and becomming a reproof and terrour, to evil. And so only, can they fully evidence, that they bear not the sword of power and authority, in vain. <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 3, 4. This would truly render them a blessing to the People, under their government. For then, all under them, that live in all godliness and honesty, would not be disturbed or interrupted in their good and well-pleasing way to God, but countenanced and encouraged, Then would obedience be payd by Saints to them, as Christs true Vice-gerents. By this Character of what a true Magistracy and Ministry should be, have we, as in type and figure, what, most certainly will, in truth and substance, be manifested, at Christs second coming, to Rule over the world in general; and saints, in particular. As to his true saints, the obedience as well as command, will be given and paid, in one and the same spirit of everlasting righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness, in head and members, governours and governed. The Governour will command nothing, but what's the known gain and true interest of the governed to obey him, in. Where the interests and designs of the governours and governed, are in a flat contrariety, all is in pieces. The utmost extent then of saints prayers and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:206287:13"/> longing desires, on the accounts above mentioned, is, that they may see the King, whose unquestionable right it is, take to himself his great power and reign over all For, under him only, can they ever find the compleat fulfilling of these words, their leading a quiet and peaceable life, in all godliness and honesty.</p>

                  <p>It is the good will of God, all should be restored into the first-covenant righteous life of their own nature, lost by the fall. This is the first great benefit of the death of our nature, and surrender of that righteous life in sacrifice to God, in Christs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. This is the common, general, or universal salvation, all men are capable of, and may actually receive, if they will. This first benefit of Christs death, is, in some degree, as to the restored light of nature, actually received by all; and may be received in the life thereof. And hereby are they afresh capacitated for the knowledge of the Truth (or Gospel-life in Christs new-creature-spirit, that is everlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and truth) by its own beamings forth upon their natural understandings. This spiritual light discovers that life in Christ, that is absolute salvation to all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers thereof. But, this Gospel-life in Christ, is refused, hated and finally turned from, by those that it is shewed and offered to, in and by its own convincing spiritual light, as the righteous life of mans own nature is, by thousands, that are convincingly shewd and offered that, in and by that common and general light of
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:206287:13"/> nature, set up afresh in every man that comes into this world. By the first benefit of Christs death (the restored light, or also life of mans own nature) are all brought, more or less, into what will be interpreted a kind of view and knowledge of their needing what was, at first, figuratively represented to <hi>Adam,</hi> in the Tree of Life; even that more excellent creature-life, in the Mediatour, in which any man or angel ever could be saved. By the first benefit of Christs death, to all men (the light and life of the Law) are they put upon anew trial, how they will demean themselves, as to the lawful or unlawful use of the Law, or life thereof, in their restored nature. The obedient surrender thereof, by death, in sacrifice to God, under the Gospel-Cross, or crucifying work of Christs Gospel-spirit, in order to receive the life thereof, this is the right and lawful use of it, for their everlasting salvation. A wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full detaining it, through inordinate love to it, and fixed enmity to the Cross and Gospel-spirit of Christ, is the unlawful use of it, to their everlasting damnation. For, this is a sinning after the similitude of <hi>Adam</hi>'s transgression, which done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by men, in their own persons (after universall experience of the dreadfull consequents of the first sin, and all warnings, since, given, to prevent the like) layes them, for ever, under wrath, as trees twice dead, once, in and with the first <hi>Adam,</hi> and then again, after restored by the second, into the life of the first. The common salvation, delivering from filth of flesh, or of the corrupt spirit of nature, is in order to a yet greater mercy, as the crowning benefit of Christs death, our receiving the gospel or new-covenant life. This onely secures from returning to filth of flesh, and cleanses also from all filth of spirit, or enmity to the power of godliness, in the spirit of grace, that is found under all the form of godliness and righteousnes of man, in his spirit of nature, with its restored life of the Law. They that by gospel-light, receive the knowledg of the truth (or sight of Christs gospel-life, that is everlasting righteousness and truth) and then wilfully sin against it, hate, and reject it, they do for ever exclude themselves from all benefit of his sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and fall irrecoverably under his fiery indignation; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27. But it is the good will of God, and acceptable in his sight, that by partaking of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon salvation, in the restored righteous first-covenant-life of the Law, which is but shadow, men may be brought to the knowledge of the truth, in the second.</p>

To know the true God, by living in the spirit of his son, is eternal life; 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 20. The whole world (all mankind, in their own nature, corrupt or righteous) lies in wickedness, filth of flesh or spirit, and so, under the power of the wicked one, the devil, exposed to all manner of deceits. True spiritual Saints, only, are secured from his wiles, by the clear knowledg of the divine mind, in Christs creature-spirit of infallible truth, which reveales the whole mystery of God the Father and of Christ. God, in his
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:206287:14"/> single, uncompounded divine essence, is one. The Mediatour is not of one; <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 20. He consists of two distinct natures or spirits, divine and creaturely, which fitts him for his mediating office, between pure divinity and meer creaturality. Bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed Angels and highest spiritual Saints, are meer creatures, and never will be more. They will, in this sence, need the Mediatour to eternity, as by his creature-medium, capable to receive the vision and enjoyment of the infinite divinity. To acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg God most high, in his single divine essence, and the Mediatour, as the divine form and supream creature-image of God, most intimatly one with the divine Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is a right owning of the one true God, and the one Mediatour between him and man. And this now, also, the man Christ Jesus is; as through the death of our changable nature, made under the Law, raised into the conjunctive divine and everlasting righteous creature-life of the Mediatour; and the actual opener thereof to men, under the gospel-dispensation, so as never revealed to any former generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons under, or before the renewed dispensation of the Law, at <hi>Sinai,</hi> though saving<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believed in, by spiritual Saints, in those former ages. Divine nature was from eternity. Creature-nature was set up by the divine, in personal union with it self, from everlasting, in the Mediatour. That which was possessed by the divine, in the beginning of his way <hi>(Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23.) towards the creation of the World, was distinct from it, though in personal union with it. In the man Christ, as exalted into this divine and creature-life of the Mediatour, dwells the fulness of the Godhead, bodily. And the original creature-life, into which he is exalted, is the living word of God, that is called God (1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 1.) The perfect knower and declarer of the whole mind and counsel of God, about the salvation of his creatures. The man Christ, as exalted into the life thereof, is the declarer and performer of the divine will, the infallible Judg of all Angels and Men, and righteous recompencer of them, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly as found in compliance with, or final and incorrigible rebellion against the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared will of God. His al-searching eye pierces to the bottom-thought of all hearts, and will bring all into open and general view, to the unspeakable joy of spiritual Saints, and everlasting shame of incorrigible sinners; <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 12, 13. The spirit of the branch, brought forth by the creature-root in the Mediatour, in a changable state of life, was the immediate root of all changable first-creation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and life. This was transiated, by way of death and resurrection, into the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable life of its creature-root and divine father, from the foundation of the World. Hereby became he, of the first-born of all changable first-creation beings, the first-begotten from the dead; <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, 18. And this is, by himself, when the son of man on Earth, called the son of man, in Heaven; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 13. He that ascended, is the same person, that descended into the lower parts of the Earth, all inferiour first-creation earthly nature and life, sum'd up in man. And he that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scended, is the same that ascended, far above all heavens <hi>(Eph.</hi> 4. 9, 10.) to the compleating his mediating person, in reference to angels and men, having suffered and done all, in both their natures (angelical, at first; and humane, at last) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible and requisite for the instruction and true blessedness of both. Christ, while in flesh, prayed to his Father, <hi>That having glorified him, in finishing all the work ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed</hi>

The man Christ, thus exalted, into the divine and creature-glories of God the Mediatour, hath a Life, and so a Name above every name, of any meer creature, angel or man. The divine, and originally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable, and twice transformed changable creature-nature, angelical and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane, into the conjunctive divine and originally unchangable creature-life, do all make up one and the same person of the Mediatour, the wonderful he, that such strangly differing things are spoken of; in Scripture, as the highest wisdom of man can never unriddle. This is he, that in the full comprehensiveness of his mediating person, made the worlds, is Heir of all things, and Judge of all men and angels; <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 31. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 27.</p>

                  <p>Christ, as the Lamb slain from the foundation of the World, in his changable angelical nature, was ready at hand, on the first sin and fall, to bear up the pillars of the first world. He presented his obedience to that spiritual Law, man sinned against, together with his readiness and willingness to repeat the same over again, in our nature, and so to pay the ransom for all men (removing the guilt, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all, through the sin of the first) and redeem them out of the fore bondage, they were all cast into. So are they brought back into the first-covenant life or light of their nature, for a second trial in their own persons, as to their lawful use thereof, in sacrifice to God, in order to receive that more excellent life of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting righteousness, offered at first, in the tree of Life. If men satisfy themselves with Christs redemption-gift of that life of the Law (he crucified in his own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son) as a state of true rest, they will never arrive at that second and crowning gift of Christ, that everlasting righteous new-creation-life, which he advanced our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into, in his own person. Evil angels did first set up the changably righteous first-covenant-life of the Law, in their angelical nature, in unchangable enmity to God and his unchangable new-creature-life of the Gospel. And <hi>Adam,</hi> listening to their suggestion, ran into the like errour, through a sinful dotage upon, and inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate love to the fading first-covenant-life of his humane nature (figured to him in the Tree of good and evil, as having but such a goodness in it, as by the unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full use thereof might be turned into evil) rejecting the second, presented to him, in the Tree of Life. Man, being inferiour to angels, in his first-covenant-life, though perfect in his kind, and not under such strong and clear spiritual-light, as they, and beguiled into the error, by their overreaching subtilty, was found capable of pardon; the fallen angels, not. They that say, <hi>Adam</hi> should have kept up, and established him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in that righteous life of the Law, wherein created; and consequently that men when restored by Christ, into the free exercise of the said Life, again, are to keep there, as a state of everlasting Salvation, and true blessedness, they do teach direct rebellion against the Lord, and his new-covenant-law. They assure them, that if they do that, which indeed is a sinning after the similitude of <hi>Adams</hi> transgression,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:206287:15"/> they shall be saved. For, his presumptuous keeping up and exalting the fading life and righteousness he was possessed of, by the first-creation, against that, repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to him, in the Tree of Life, provoked God to take from him that he had. The unlawful keeping it up, in a preference to the second, was his sin. He fell by his sin, from a changable state of subjection to the second, into a state of enmity to it, and God took from him, the first, and left him capable both of recovering the first, and by the right use thereof, of attaining the second. But, God gave up angels to their wilful choice of the first, and suffers them to keep and make their best of it, as fixed in unchangable enmity to the second. All along this world, are they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to use all the wisdom, power, sading glory, and excellencies of their angeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal nature, as fixed in unchangable enmity to God and his new-creature, Gospel-spirit of Grace. On this great mistake about the first <hi>Adams</hi> sin, and then as great, about the second <hi>Adams</hi> death, by which the ransom was paid for it, how is it pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible one word should run right, as to what is a sinning after the similitude of the first <hi>Adams</hi> transgression, or a true conformity to the second <hi>Adams</hi> death? If the death of Christ be confined singly to the violent dissolution of his body (which he exposed himself to, from the <hi>Jews)</hi> not considering at all, the surrender and loss of the first-covenant righteous life of his natural spirit, as made under the Law, for the everlasting righteous life of his Gospel-spirit, how can Saints alive yet in the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body, be conformed to Christ, in his death and resurrection? as, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3,—5. and <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1,—3. Yea, what if the Gospel or new-creature spirit of everlasting righteousness, be utterly denied, or not considered and owned, which performed the death-work on Christs natural spirit, in the life of the Law, as it had on the angelical spirit of the Branch from the foundation of the World? Let creature-nature in Christs person, before his taking flesh, be denied, and the death of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in him, when taken, confined to that of the body, only; what Gospel are we like to have, from such hands, or what aim at a Gospel-state? If no elder date of creature-nature, in Christ, be owned, then his taking flesh, what becomes of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>searchable riches of his person, consisting in the fellowship of divine and creature-nature, from everlasting, and kept as a hidden mystery and secret, till opened by the man Christ <hi>(Joh.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>Rom.</hi> 16. 25, 26.) which <hi>Paul</hi> owns as the very matter and substance of his Gospel-Ministry? <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9.

If the very Gospel-life and principle be exploded, and excluded out of what is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be Gospel-doctrine, where are we? If when restored by Christ into the lost righteous life of the Law, we live not to our selves therein, but quit that with him, by a holy death, that we may live unto him that died for us, in the same Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel spirit, our nature in his person does now live, then have we the wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>This does <hi>Paul</hi> will and command, in the authority of the spirit of Christ, in which ordained an apostle, and preacher of the Gospel to the Gentiles. Spiritual Saints only can thus rightly pray, in the spirit of Christ, which as 'tis the spirit of all true Prophecy or interpreting the Scriptures to men, So of all right prayer to God, for themselves and others. This spirit in saints is the infallible Seer, declarer and doer of the whole counsell of God, and right asker in prayer, of what is accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divine mind and will of God. True Saints, in this spirit, lift up Holy hands to God, without any wrath or enmity to, any doubting of, questioning or disputing the truths or things, they speak of, or pray for. In the strong and cleer exercise of their spiritual mind, they admit not the mixtures of their naturall or fleshly, that is full, both of wrath, doubtings and disputes, against the spirit of Christ in them, and all the things, words, prayers, or concerns thereof. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore, immediatly, on his Gospel-conversion (from the first-covenant-life of the Law, in his renewed nature, to the second covenant life of the Gospel, in the new creature spirit of grace; from the life of his holy flesh, to the life of God's holy spirit,) would no longer confer with flesh and blood, the natural, fleshly mind in himself or others, in preaching Gospel to men, or putting up his prayers to God. The natural spirit, in its own way and course, is a wrathful, doubting, disputing, quarrelsom, contradicting blasphemer, against the Gospel-spirit, in the saint him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.

                  </epigraph>
                  <p>These women, not denying a litteral, must be allowed a mystical meaning, also. The natural man of the saint, in the uncrucified, untransformed life, motion, and way of its own mind and will, is, in scripture, signified by the woman, from the changable and weak nature thereof. These mystical women, in saints, must adorn themselves in modest apparel, with shame-fac'dness and sobriety, not broidered hair, gold, pearls, or costly aray. Here's an affirmative and a negative part in this advice to the woman or natural man, in saints, shewing what must, and what must not be found about them. <hi>Peter</hi> ioyns his advice with <hi>Paul,</hi> in this mystical sence of both their words; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 1,—4. <hi>Wives, be in subjection to your own Husbands; and your adorning, let it not be that outward, of plaited hair, gold, or apparel: but the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible; the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit, which is in the sight of God, of great price.</hi> The wives, <hi>Peter</hi> speaks of, are the same with the women mentioned by <hi>Paul,</hi> the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural man in every true saint, that's to be subject to the spiritual, whose mind and will ought to be obeyed and done by it. The litteral womans duty to her husband, is recorded, as a type of this mystery and truth; 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 3. 5, 6. <hi>Thus, in old time, holy women adorned themselves, in modest apparel, not costly aray, being in subjection to their own husbands, as</hi> Sarah <hi>obeyed</hi> Abraham, <hi>calling him Lord.</hi> This obedience and subjection, in the litteral type, must, in the mystical truth of it, be found in the natural to the spiritual man of the Saint, and therein, to Christ, as Lord, Ruler and Husband to the whole Saint. The costly aray, forbidden his natural man, are the beautifying ornaments thereof, in the fruitful exercise of a restored first-covenant life, rendring him comly through that sort of comliness, by the Lord himself, afresh, put upon him. All, God does for men, in this kind, he calls their own comliness or beauty, charging them that trust therein, with whoredom, and a murderous mind of enmity against him, as (by such doating on that fading glory of their own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed and adorned nature, that's but a perishing vanity) found in a despiteful hatred to his spirit of grace, and never fading life and glory thereof, which by the obedient surrender and loss of the first, they are offered the possession of, by a new creation. Thus do men come, after all fair shews in the flesh, or restored life and glory of their own nature, to be dealt with, as mystical and most criminal adulter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers and murderers. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14, 15, <hi>and vers.</hi> 38. Man lives to himself, and brings forth fruit to himself only, in the most fruitful exercise of the restored first-covenant-life of the Law, in his own nature; not unto God, till possessed of,
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:206287:16"/> and walking in the fruitful exercise of his new-covenant-life, in the spirit of the Gospel; <hi>Hos.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 4. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> God delights only in such worship and obedience as is performed in spirit and truth; in his Gospel-spirit, that is everlasting righteousness and truth. The spirit of nature, with its life of the Law, is but Letter, figure and shadow, in all the life, glory, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and righteousnes thereof; shadow of the unchangable life, glory, wisdom and righteousnes of God, in his Gospel-spirit, the heavenly creature-image of his infinite divinity. God gives man all the fading life and Glory of his own nature, which he calls mans own, in distinction from what he calls his own, in that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly creature-image of himself, set up by him, in personal union with his divinity, from everlasting, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 22, 23. This, that was first set up in the Creatour, is last in the creature. First that which is natural, was set up in Angel and Man, and after, that which is spiritual. God says of this spiritual, everlasting righteous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life, <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with my own?</hi> Mat. 20. 15. All that finally refuse to surrender all that is their own, in the first creation, for Gods own, in the second, perish everlastingly. All that obediently part with the former, for the latter, are everlastingly saved. Never was there any other creature-spirit, name or life, in which any man or Angel could be saved, but what God calls his own, in Christ and all true spiritual saints. If mans Soul, in the fading life and glory of its restored first-creation state, loath and hate Gods soul, his Gospel, new-creature spirit of grace; that spirit or soul of God will loath mans, for ever. The mystical woman then, (the natural spirit of man, at best,) must put off all its or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments and goodly dress, in the most fruitful exercise of its own restored first-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant righteous life. Life and all, must go, that God may know what to do with us, by bestowing upon us, the everlasting life and Glory of the second. This was typed, in that speech of <hi>Moses,</hi> from God to the <hi>Israelites,</hi> which they obeyed; <hi>Exod.</hi> 33. 5, 6. If, with <hi>Laodicea,</hi> men adorn and keep up themselves, in the fading life, mystical riches, glory and ornament of their own nature, for salvation (rest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confident in their holy flesh, so as to reckon, they need not any thing that is to be had in Gods holy spirit) they are miserable, wretched, poor, blind, and naked, having nothing of durable, everlasting life, riches or cloathing, about them, when they reckon they have all; and are found despising as nothing, that which is all. The Gospel-spirit of the Cross, comes to seize, and offer up in sacrifice to God, all the fading good things in nature, that they rest in, for salvation, in order to give them its own life, in which alone they can be saved. The enmity that lies hid under all the green grass, or fair shews in the flesh, to Gods holy spirit, that comes to man that holy flesh, is unpardonable, when unchangable. By wilful refusal to part with whats but changably good, in their own nature, figuratively signified by gold, pearls, broidered hair, and costly apparel, are men found enemies to the Gospel-spirit and Cross of Christ, and render themselves uncapable of his durable life, ornaments and glory. Come we then, to the affirmative part of this joynt advice of <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul,</hi> in the true mystical reach and significancy thereof, which is, that the natural man, in every Saint, be adorned with a meek and quiet spirit; the same, with what
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:206287:17"/>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> means by modest apparel, shamefac'dness and sobriety, &amp; with such good works as are performable only, in the spirit and power of Godliness. Here is a joynt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription of the right posture, garb and demeanour of the natural man in the saint, as sensible of enmity to its spiritual Lord and Husband, in all the riches, wisdom, righteousness, beauty, glory and ornament thereof. <hi>Paul</hi> found himself, in all that life, glory and ornament, a Persecutor of his true Lord, in his spiritual subjects, and verily thought he did God service, therein. But presently, on the heavenly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance and call of his Lord, did he put off his ornaments, quit the fading glory, righteousness, and wisdom of his natural man, with all the reasonings and words thereof. He conferred not with flesh and blood, in himself or others, as to what he should do, in obedience to his spiritual Lord. Yea, he gladly received the sentence of death within him, as to the most blameless righteous-life of his natural spirit, in which, by Gospel-light, he finds he had been guilty of spiritual uncleanness and murder. He was presently found, on this account, in the meek, quiet, broken frame of his natural spirit, willing to have the sentence of death speedily executed upon it, as the only way of delivering him from that state of life, which now he finds to be a body of sin and death. Thus was his natural man brought into a right frame of obedience to the spiritual Lord and Husband thereof. And so came this mystical woman, in <hi>Paul,</hi> to be adorned, as a professor of true godliness, with a better sort of good-works, than ever he experienced in the form of godliness, the righteous life of his own nature. The good works, performable only in the new-creature-spirit, and power of godliness, are spiritual believers, most carefully to maintain, as truly good and profitable to salvation; <hi>Tit.</hi> 3. 8. This for of good works, (which belong not, at all, to the covenant of works, but are performable only in the spirit of Grace) were ingredients into <hi>Abrahams</hi> justification before God; <hi>Jam.</hi> 2. 21,—24. Not the deeds of the Law, or works performable by him, in the first-covenant righteous life of his natural spirit; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. 2,-5. The good works, wrought in the Gospel-spirit of grace, are as much more excellent than what are done in the natural first covenant-spirit and life of the Law, as the Gospel-spirit of God, than the Law-spirit of man. The fruits differ as much as the roots or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, whence they flow. When the spirit of Christ enters a man, as ruling principle of life and action, the mystical woman, or spirit of man, is to lay aside her fading crown, scepter and government, and become wholly subject to this new ruler. The natural spirit, with its first-covenant-life, as not found in rebellion against the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, was the mystical <hi>Isaac, Abraham</hi> offered up, in his own person; who once prayed. <hi>O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> that</hi> Ishmael <hi>might live in thy sight! Ishmael</hi> was a type of the first-covenant-spirit, as found in enmity to the second; <hi>Gal.</hi> 4. 29. That prayer of <hi>Abraham</hi> then, may seem to import a secret love in him, to his own nature, in the first-covenant-life of the Law, as the state in which he desired to remain, and hoped to inherit the kingdom of God. But true godliness, with the good works thereof, can never be found in this mystical woman, the natural spirit of the saint, but by a right obedient parting with her own life, name, ornament and riches. For then she receives the spiritual life and riches of her true Lord and Husband, comes to bear his
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:206287:17"/> Name, and wear such new apparel, or change of raiment, as he will put upon her, which will never wax old or fail her, as was typed by the <hi>Israelites</hi> Clothes and Shoes, that waxed not old, in forty years, upon them; <hi>Deut.</hi> 29. 5. When the natural mind in saints, is transformed by death, out of its contrariety to, into har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony with the spiritual, their prayers are no longer hindred by the contrary-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness of the fleshly to the spiritual; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 7. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. The natural mind, so far as uncrucified, is an infidel, as to all Gospel things or truths, and so, an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal yoke-fellow for the spiritual, in saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 14, 15. But when changed, and translated by a holy death, into the life of the spiritual, the whole man of the Saint, becomes a Temple of the living God; <hi>vers.</hi> 16.

This great truth, held forth in the Type, should make such women as are also true saints, more careful than any, to perform this duty, in the letter, so as exactly to answer the duty of their literal marriage-relation, and more careful yet, to perform the mystical truth figured therein, by living in the will and spirit of Christ, their true Lord and Husband, in a holy silence and subjection in all things, to him.</p>

                  <p>These words have also their truth in the letter: but the mystical truth, is the principal intendment of them. The natural spirit in the saint is not to teach her mystical, husband, the spirit of Christ; which she does presumptuously undertake, when in her inlightned understanding, she contends against the mind of Christ, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincingly discovered to her. She strives by the words of her own Wisdom, for the doing of her own will, in a known contrariety to the will of Christ, and words of his wisdom. So, she usurpes the authority of the man. The female or natural spirit of Christ, did not thus: spake not its own words, nor did its own will, in the spotles righteous life of the Law: But, denied both, to speake the words, and do the will of God, in his Gospel-spirit of everlasting truth and righteousnes. Where
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:206287:18"/> the wisdom of man is teacher, the will of man is done. In this usurping the place of Christs Gospel-spirit, all his words are rejected and decried. Thus man joynes with the evil Angels, in the changable, female, fallible spirit of nature, against God and his infallible, manly new-creature-spirit of grace. They joyntly set up that accurs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed other Gospel, Satan at first preached to Eve; Ye shall not die at all; Here is everlasting life, in the righteousness and Glory of your own nature. And this, the living word of God Proclaimes to be but a fading flower, in both. But though hand joyn in hand evil men with evil angels, in this project, they shall not pass unpunished. Let their first-creation Mountain be never so strong, it will be dashed in pieces, and fired, by the inresistable Power and unquenchable wrath of him that is infinitely above them. This false Gospel of man and Satan, (crying peace with God, where there is nothing but enmity to God, and assuring their followers, they will confirm or make good their words, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13.) the true Gospel-spirit of Christ has declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, will have such generall reception with professours, in these last times, that there will be little or no hearing at all, for one right word of Christs everlasting Gospel life. The Woman, or naturall spirit, in evill men and Angels, thus presumptuously setting up her own wisdom and will, against the transcendently superiour will and Wisdom of the known Gospel-spirit of Christ, is the very mysticall <hi>Babylon, the Mother of harlots and Abominations of the Earth.</hi> The vast numbers of Angels and men, engaged in this Babylonish spirit, must, in conclusion, all fall together, under the final triumphs of divine justice. This Woman, in Saints themselves, must keep silence, in Gospel-Churches. For it is not permitted her to speake. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14. 34. By death, and the utter abolition of all the life and motion of her own will and understanding, can this Woman in the Saint, be brought to a perfect and absolute silence, and so, quickened up, into a newness of life, in everlasting harmony of mind and will, with her spiritual Lord and husband. So only can she be found in a uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versall obedience to him, in all things. If the Wisdom of man be admitted speaker in the Gospel Church, it will call mans natural things, (the fading glory, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, rigteousness and life of man, by the same names, the wisdom of God in the spiritual Saint calls the things of God) spiritual and heavenly; to the utter exclusi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of such things as truly are so, which makes unutterable confusion, and vain jangling, to worse then no purpose. In sum, the spirit of Christ, in himself and Gospel-Saints, is to be acknowledged the only teacher in his Gospel Church. And the spirit of man, ought in silence, to learn obedience to the mind and will thereof. But, in stead of this silence, who else, in a manner, but this mystical woman, is found to be the only owned speaker and teacher in the pretended Gospel-Churches of Christ?</p>

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:206287:18"/> himself or saints, can ever sin or be deceived; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 9. The fleshly mind that remains long in the saint (after the seed of spiritual Life is quickened up into the birth of the man-child, in him) does nothing else but sin, till fully run down to death, crucified and extinguished in all the life and motion of it. So the whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the saint, is not without sin (1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8.) till this flesh, warring against the spirit of Christ in him <hi>(Gal.</hi> 5. 17.) this body of sin and death, (which we find <hi>Paul</hi> complaining of, long after a Gospel-saint <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 24.) be wholly slain and abolished, which may seem seldom, if ever, so to be, till the death of the body; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 12. No absolute perfection in any kind, while in this life. No compleat being at home with the Lord, while pilgrimaging in the body. This made <hi>Paul</hi> desire to be dissolved. Here then is signified the precedency of the new-covenant-spirit, to the first, in saying, <hi>Adam was first formed, then Eve.</hi> Christ, in his new-covenant Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness, was set up, by the immediate workmanship of the infinite divinity, from everlasting. This spirit of the true <hi>Adam,</hi> which was the hand, by which, the Angels, <hi>Adam, Eve,</hi> and all things were created, was not deceived. But the Woman, or natural spirit, at its best, in Angel, <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> was deceived, and found in the transgression. These words can only be taken in this mystical sence. For the litteral <hi>Adam,</hi> as well as <hi>Eve,</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and found in the transgression. <hi>In him, all died;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 22. <hi>By his first offence, death reigned over all and judgment came upon all men, to condemnation; Rom.</hi> 5. 17, 18. The only relief of all men (fallen, in and with the first) is to be found in this <hi>Adam,</hi> that could never be deceived. When the lost life of the first, is restored and set up a fresh in men, by the second, besides some dreggy remains of the corrupt nature, 'tis of a tainted blood, tinctur'd with a traiterous, heady, high-minded temper, in enmity to God, and the spirit of the second <hi>Adam.</hi> This enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is no ways extinguishable, but by the death of this woman, the natural spirit in the highest restored life of the Law. Nothing short of such death can bring her into a total sil<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The mystical woman, or natural spirit of the saint, in the restored righeous life thereof, inheriting a state of enmity and rebellion against God, by the first sin (as was evident in <hi>Paul)</hi> is no way curable, but by child-bearing; such child-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as brings certain death to her. Bodily death sometimes happens in litteral child-bearing: in mystical, alwayes the woman dies, in order to bring forth the new-creation-man-child. Christ uses litteral child-bearing to signify this mystical-truth; <hi>Joh.</hi> 16. 20, 21. A woman in travel, hath sorrow, but when delivered, remembers no more the anguish, for joy that a man is born into the world. 'Tis
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:206287:19"/> alwayes a man-child, a son, that's born in the saint, by the kindly death of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural spirit, which is the only way by which that mystical woman can be saved. Christ, known after the flesh, in the restored righteous life of the Law, is a fleshly, first-covenant-bridegroom, as he was to his disciples, when personally in flesh with them, upon earth. And on his with-drawing from, and leaving such first-covenant-saints, they wither, for want of his fructifying husbandly influences upon them, there, which exposes them to the same sorrow, his personal departure out of the flesh, exposed his disciples, to. In this case, are saints ready to think, the Lord has utterly forsaken them, and that they shall never hear more of him: Nor indeed shall, in that first-covenant life or comforts thereof, but as a better comforter, in the second, as to his disciples, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. Now, in order to the birth of the spiritual man-child, the woman, or natural spirit expires and dies away, under the work of the Cross, so as to cease, for ever, from the activity, life and motion of her own will. And so comes she to be quickened up, into the spiritual life of her child, which becomes also, her mystical Lord, Head and Ruler, in the same person. And so is the whole person of the saint, brought under the spiritual government, and head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship of Christ. In this mystical child-bearing, is the woman to continue in faith, love and holiness, with sobriety, or chastity. The faith here meant, is a faith in Christ's spiritual life, which sets before her, the same kind of joy, that made the natural man in Christ himself, willing to endure the Cross, despising the shame of the marr'd visage and state thereof. This faith must be continued in, and found trial-proof, by holding out, under the utmost pangs of death to the natural spirit, as to its first-covenant-life and fruitfulness. <hi>Paul,</hi> in the midst of his sufferings, had that joy set before him, which made him, not to reckon all the sufferings of the present time, worthy to be compared with the glory of that spiritual life, that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 18. Christ, in that spiritual life, into which he rais'd our nature, in himself, out of the death of the pure natural state thereof, is the Object of faith to all spiritual saints. Our natural spirit or man, at best, can only by a conformity to his death therein, be raised into, and possessed of the same spiritual life, that is absolute salvation to us. By continuing stedfast in our spiritual faith, we shall also continue in love and obedience to Christ in his spiritual life. And so shall we pass quietly, through all the death-pangs of our natural spirits, with holiness and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety, or chastity to Christ, not looking back to the gratifying contentments there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, or love to any thing in the first-creation, that's enmity to Chirst, and spiritual adultery, <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 4.</p>

                  <p>THE word, <hi>Bishop</hi> or <hi>Overseer,</hi> here, is appropriated to such as take care of the Church of God, spiritual saints. He that desires this Office, as meetly qualified to performe it, and is found diligent in the performance of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sires a high dignity, and does a good work. Such are to take heed to themselves, and flock of Christ or Church of God, over which the Holy Ghost hath made them Overseers, and feed them, as <hi>Paul</hi> admonishes the Elders of the Church at <hi>Ephesus; Act.</hi> 20. 28. He declares to them, how he had discharged his part, in this good work, keeping himself clear from the blood of all, by declaring to them, all the counsel of God; <hi>Vers.</hi> 26, 27. Such Gospel-doctrine, as the words of Gods wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom amount unto, are true Bishops to feed the Church of God, with, for the edify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nourishing, strengthening and building them up in their spiritual, Gospel-life. That which qualifies to be such overseers of spiritual saints, is their being eminent seers of God, more experienced, strong and clear, in the spiritual Gospel-light and life of Christ, and so, able to dispence the fuller and clearer knowledge of Christ, to saints of inferiour attainments, therein. The faithful performance of this good work, is the most acceptable service to Christ, and greatest good, any can do, to his fellow-creatures, or himself. Prophets, under the Law, were put into this Office, by the same spirit of Christ, as Elders, Apostles and Fathers, under the Gospel. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing fits any to be the Lords watchman over saints, but a receiving the word from the Lords own mouth; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17. If he fail'd in the discharge of his Office, the guilt of their blood that perished, would lye upon him. If he faithfully discharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, he was free from their blood, with <hi>Paul,</hi> though they perished; <hi>vers.</hi> 18,—21. Two sorts of persons are to be warned by spiritual watch-men (besides the feeding of spiritual saints) the righteous and the wicked; such, as in the corrupt spirit of Nature, and enormous lusts and practices thereof, are enemies of all righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, God's and man's, too; and such as in the form of godliness, and restor'd righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of man, are found enemies to the power of godliness and righteousness of God, in his Gospel-spirit of grace. Of these two sorts of men, the first-covenant righteous, in their restored spirit of nature, have, all along, been found the fiercest opposers of the testimony and warning, given by spiritual watch-men. The corrupt, heathen party, living at random, without hope or God in the world, have nothing to lose. The righteous party of men, rich, full, wise, strong, and honourable in Christ, by the knowledge of him, after the flesh, and fruitful exercise of the first-covenant righteous life of the Law (purchased for them, and afresh set up in them,
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:206287:20"/> by the redeemer) these wax confident and hopeful, that heaven is their own. And they want not, for such false Teachers, as will confirm them therein. The true spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual watchmans testimony, strikes at all this, root and branch, life and hope, riches, wisdom, righteousness and glory, as a fading flower, a perishing nothing; and availing nothing at all, as to eternal-life and true blessedness. This doctrine layes the Axe to the root of all humane interest. The righteous, first-covenant saint, then, with his holy flesh, flies in the face of this doctrine of Gods holy spirit, in true saints, that strikes at the root, and rases the very foundation of all their hopes. Hence, hath this sort of men, a first-covenant people of God, been found, briars, thorns and scorpions, to true spiritual watch-men <hi>(Ezek.</hi> 2. 6.)

The true Bishop, thus skill'd and instructed himself, as to things new and old, is able to instruct others, to the kingdom of God. Thus, the whole mystery of Godliness, in the second-covenant spirit, and Satans whole mystery of iniquity (by incouraging men to rest in and keep up the first, against the second) fly open together and at once.

This turns all the changably good things, or <hi>Laodicean</hi> treasures of a first-covenant-life, into filthy lucre, which the Gospel-Bishop must not be gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of, or covet after. The Cross of Christ is the only cure of all this evil. The crucifying of the natural man of the saint (which is the flesh, that opposes the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and spirit of Christ) extinguishes all unlawful love to the most charming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirables, visible or invisible, in the whole first-creation world of vanities, that satan

The whole person of the Bishop, must be thus well ruled, before he can be fit to rule, under Christ, over his Church. <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> under the Conduct of first-covenant-light and wisdom, had walked faithfully, in the fruitful exercise of his first-covenant-life, so thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self truly acceptable to the Lord. But he wept sorely, when he came to find his great mistake <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>rein. A sentence of death is pronounced upon him, in all that ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling light, life, obedience and fruitfulness, in order to set his house, heart, or spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, in that new-creation rectitude and order (under a new ruler, and in a newness of life) in which alone he can become well-pleasing to God. He was sorely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized with this amazing discovery (by a beam of new-light, from the spirit of Christ, darted into him) that all his walking before God in truth, and with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect heart, doing that which he thought good in Gods sight, as well as his own, was no such matter, but indeed, that he had been, all along, in a state and course of enmity to God, on which therefore death is pronounced; and so, on his natural-spirit, therein.</p>
                  <p>And on this death, obediently submitted to, a newness of life is put into his spirit, figured
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:206287:21"/> by the new life, given, in an extraordinary way, to his body, out of a mortal sickness; <hi>Esa.</hi> 8. <hi>Paul,</hi> after all his good opinion of himself, in holy flesh, by the light of Christs holy spirit, is brought to see and call that whole state of life and righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness (in which he had walked faithfully, and kept a good conscience) <hi>a body of sin and death,</hi> which he therefore prayed to be delivered from. He found, that in all his form of godliness, or righteousness of man, he had been practising direct enmity against God, even when he verily thought he had done him service. As the case stands with man, since the fall, he is, in all the righteous life and action of his resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red nature, in a secret combination against the spirit of Christ, and his rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, over him. Satan secretly inveigles men by their very righteousness and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, in the first-covenant, into a confederacy with him, against Christ, and the second. A considerable progress then, towards the death of the former, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable growth up into the life and strength of the latter, rendring the whole person, or mystical house of the Saint in good order, all this is required in a true Gospel-Bishop, or Overseer and Feeder of the Church of God.</p>

                  <p>Man, in the highest wisdom, light and righteousness of the first covenant, is a novice at Gospel things; cannot receive, and how then, declare them? Thousands of pretended Gospel-ministers, in but the life of the Law, are the unlikeliest hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of true Gospel-preaching, to their advantage, in the whole world. They deny the principles and rase the very foundations of Gospel. And if the foundations be destroyed, or denied, what can be said to them, or done with them, in discourse? They are perfectly unreasonable and untreatable, as to Gospel matters. This sort of novices, are surely unfit to feed Christs Gospel-flock, that contradict and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phem all that Gospel-doctrine, they should feed them with. Father then, the novice, more properly here meant, that is not to be a Gospel-bishop, is not only such a one as has begun in the spirit, by receiving Gospel-light, but such a Neophyte as is but newly or lately planted into Christs Gospel-life, a babe, youngling or novice, therein. Such a one is unfit for this high service to Christ, in his Church. But as a litteral Child, or novice in naturalls, may grow a wise, able, knowing man, as to the things of man; So a spiritual novice, that is yet to be fed and taught, may grow so expert in the things of God, as to be a teacher and feeder of others. <hi>Apollo,</hi> an eloquent man, and mighty in the Scriptures, instructed in the way of the Lord, and fervent in spirit, was yet but a novice, as to Gospel-matters. <hi>Aquila</hi> and <hi>Priscilla</hi> therefore, two of his hearers, expounded to him the way of God, more perfectly, <hi>Act.</hi> 18. 24, 26.</p>

<pb n="40" facs="tcp:206287:22"/> of the saint himself, in the restored righteous life of the Law, by which, made knowing, wise, rich, strong, honourable, and beautifull, in his own nature. This self-exalting thought in the evil Angels (by doting upon and priding themselves in the first-covenant-life and Glory, Wisdom, and Righteousness, which they had in a superiority to man, in their angelical nature) grew to that extreamity, that they kept up that, in wilful disobedience against (in sted of obediently parting with it, to receive) the yet transcendently superior creature-life, clearly shew'd and offered to them by a new creation. And multitudes of men, renewed into the first covenant righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness and glory of their own nature, do so dote upon that, and themselves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, that they refuse the same more excellent life, the evil Angels did, when convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cingly set before their eyes, by its own Gospel-light. And through such pride and presumption, do they fall into the same condemnation with devils. In the Glory and excellency of their first-creation life, turned into unchangable enmity to God and the second, do the evil Angels proudly exalt themselves above the stars of God, new-creation Angels and Saints, yea Christ, and God himself; the infinite divinity, and the fountain new creature-spirit, or living word of God, that is also called God, <hi>Jo.</hi> 1. 1.

In all his profession of love and service to Christ, in the spirit of the Law, be joyns with the devil, against the very Christ, the spirit of the Gospel. Thus did <hi>Paul himself,</hi> for a season. Man, in this case, labours to justle out of the world, the Gospel-spirit, and all the right words thereof, as a meer heap of heretical blasphemies, that would destroy all religion, and discountenance righteousness, in a holy professing sort of Christians. The design of devil and man, in all this, is, to set up their own spirit of nature, with its life of the Law, in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition to the everlasting righteous Gospel-spirit and life of Christ. Such professors flatter God with their mouths, and lye to him with their tongues. For their heart is not right with him; <hi>Psal.</hi> 78. 36, 37. They pretend the greatest service and obedience to God, in the spirit and life of the Law, and at the same time joyn with the devil, in breathing out threatnings and slaughter against the true Gospel-spirited disciples of Christ. A zeal and warmth for the former, while ignorant of the latter, is pardonable, as in <hi>Paul.</hi> But, when, against Gospel-light and conviction, such zeal is the fire of Hell, or spirit of the Devil, lodging them in unchangable enmity, to God. <hi>David,</hi> finding himself exposed to all sorts of evils, and backslidings, in the most righteous state of his own spirit, that is but a wavering, starting, unsteddy thing, beggs of God to give him his right, steddy, constant spirit of everlasting righteousness, <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. In this new-covenant spirit, man can never depart from God, nor will God, from him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32. 40. The honesty of nature, at best, is not to be trusted to, in our selves or others. Man, in the highest degree of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, as to the righteousness of his own nature, is a lie. If he trust to that, for sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, he will find it so. He that is honest and clean, as to filth of flesh, to day, may return to his old sins, in the corrupt and unrighteous spirit of nature, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row. And if men of high degree, in the restored life, Glory and honour of their nature, be a lie; What must men of low degree, in the debased, polluted state of their nature, be? see. <hi>Psal:</hi> 62. 9. Put them both into the balance, and they'l be found altogether lighter then vanity. So, <hi>Psal:</hi> 39. 5. The gravity, required in the Deacon is effected by the needful sharp discipline of the Cross, on his natural spirit, which, at best, is fickle, unstable, and lighter then vanity it self, in the whole will, life, riches and delights thereof. The work of the Cross, on all these fading materials, brings the faint into a true gravity, by thinking soberly and rightly of the state of vanity, and himself therein. The spirit of Christ, gives him quite another sight and opinion of that state and all the fading glory thereof, in the conceited excellency of which, he, before, was puffed up. What <hi>Paul,</hi> once thought himself, safe for salvation, in, he after found to be a state or body of sin and death, which if permitted to have finished his course, in, would have been his eternal
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:206287:23"/> ruine. The spirit of everlasting righteousness, by its crucifying work, rids the saint of his own frothy life of vanity, and sets up its durable life and substance in the room thereof, which renders him truly humble, grave, holy, sober, chast, and obedient to Christ and God, in all things. <hi>Not given to much wine, not greedy of filthy ucre.</hi> These words are spoken to, in the Bishop, <hi>Vers.</hi> 3. An inordinate, excessive and unlawful love to, and doting upon, the mystical wine, the fading life, fruits, righteousness, wisdom and glory of our restored nature (which are intended but as a present supply to the needy, naked, barren and polluted state, we were born in) is here prohibited. Otherwise, shall we despise and reject that durable riches, life, food and clothing, offered us in Christs Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness, in which alone we can be saved.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> writes this Epistle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> as a present supply of what he would farther inform him in, when he sees him. Herein does he state to him the severall offices of rule in the Church of God, and qualifications for them; and so, how he ought to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himself in that House or Church of the living God. This Church is the whole number of spiritual saints, Christ is head to. The spirit of the head is in every member, begetting the same mind and judgment in them all, in an everlasting uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and communion with himself and one another. This Church of God is here also called the pillar and ground of the truth. When <hi>Simon</hi> acknowledged Christ in his everlasting righteous creature-life, son of the living God, the true rock on which he builds his Church, in allusion thereto, he calles <hi>Simon, Peter,</hi> or a rock, as own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this rocky foundation of the true Church, through partaking of that spirit which is the rock. On this, Christ calles him a rock, or stone. And so is every spiritual saint a <hi>Peter,</hi> a rock. All of them are lively stones, spirited, by the living corner-stone; built on that rock, that is disallowed of men, but chosen of God; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5.

                  <p>Christ, in his wonderful and all comprehensive person, is the true and great mystery of godliness. The account here given, as to the creature-part of his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son▪ discovers to us his twofold, first and second covenant life, signified by his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing manifested in flesh, and justified in spirit. He was God manifested in flesh, or in the changable righteous life of our nature. And when he had finished the works, given him by the Father, to do therein, he sacrificed it, in that life of the Law, and raised it into his Gospel-life of everlasting righteousness, signified here, by justifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> fellowship with divine, which before was a hidden mystery. Thus is that creature-life that has immortality in it, brought to light, by the true preaching of the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which commenc'd on Christs ascending into it, in our nature, and opening all that before lay hid. True gospel-preachers declare Christ manifested in flesh, justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in spirit. Both these things, <hi>Paul</hi> received from Christ and declared to men; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 3, 4. <hi>He died for our sins, and rose again,</hi> according to the scriptures. God the Mediatour took our nature in the fleshly first-covenant-life thereof, as an earthly vail, not only upon his infinite divinity, but everlasting righteous creature-spirit, on purpose to rent and fling off the same by death, in order to raise and advance it into the life of his everlasting righteous creature-spirit, and so, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonal union, with his divine, also. Thus, has the man Christ set open that spiritual life, offered the transforming sight of it, and is become, therein, a certain pledg of our everlasting justification and acceptance with God, by partaking of the same spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, with our nature in his person. We can be finally justified, only in the same spirit, he is. So great weight is laid on the full confession of these two things that a not rightly acknowledging the latter, is interpreted and understood by the holy Ghost to be a denial of the former; as making void the principal end of his being manifested in flesh. <hi>Hereby,</hi> sayes <hi>John, know ye the spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh, is of God.</hi> And every spirit that confesseth not this, is the spirit of antichrist. What a world of spiritual saints, born of God, if the bare general acknowledgment of Christs taking flesh, were all that is here meant? But he that denies that spiritual, Gospel-state of life, in which, only the man Christ, and consequently any other man, is, or can be absolutely justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied and saved, denies also his being manifested in flesh. The advance of our nature in Christ, into personal union with the divinity (as that unchangable creature-life, into which exalted, was, from everlasting) is not the lot or portion of any man or Angel. This divine unction, is that oil of gladness, with which the man Christ is anointed, in a transcendent superiority to all his fellow-brethren of the spiritual unction, for ever. The man Christ has Gods divine nature and name in him, which is unspeakably more excellent, then any man or Angel ever can have. There is therefore no danger in worshiping the man Christ. God himself commands all his holy Angels to worship him; and all men to honour the son, even as they honour the father; <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 23. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 4-9. Saints are admitted immediate personal-union with their nature in Christ, that, in him, is in personal union with God most high. Himself prayes, that they may be one with him, and he with them, in his everlasting righteous creature-life, as he with the father and the father with him, in the infinite divine nature and life; <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 21,-23. Without all dispute, great is the mystery of godliness, wrought out, by the Mediators manifesting himself in our fleshly nature, and, by death, advancing it into his spiritual creature-nature, the most holy creature-state or place, the immediate house or supream temple of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity, in personal union with the divine inhabitant. <hi>Seen of Angels.</hi> Christs being actually manifested in flesh, was first signally witnessed by Angels, <hi>Luk:</hi> 2. 9,-14.

And in that life only, can any be everlastingly justified. Secondly, Christ as thus justified in spirit, was preached to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as the sum of all Gospel truth. The mystery of godliness (set open and brought to light in and by the man Christ, so as not before known to the sons of men, since the world began) was revealed to his apostles, and prophets, by the spirit <hi>(Eph.</hi> 3. 5.) and by them preached to the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The spiritual creature-life of Christ, was a land of distances, a state very far off, to spiritual saints, in former ages, yet seen and rejoyced in by their spiritual faith, as their salvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8. 56. Christ revealed to <hi>Paul,</hi> the unsearchable riches of his person, consisting in the fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship of his infinite divine and everlasting righteous creature-spirit, which had, till then, lain hid in God, from everlasting; <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 2,-9. The great end of Christs being manifested in flesh, was, by the death thereof, to ascend into, and open this mysterious fellowship of two natures in his person, from everlasting. By partaking of the one, are men and Angels capacitated for the everlasting light and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the other, also. The true preaching of this mystery, is the right Gospel-preaching of Christ. This we find, in <hi>Peters</hi> testimony, presently after that first signal opening of the mystery, by the effusion of the Gospel-spirit, on the Apostles; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. 22, 24. and <hi>vers.</hi> 32, 33. All true Gospel-preachers and true Prophets or interpreters of Scripture, declare Christs being manifested in our fleshly nature, and quitting the changable first-covenant righteous life thereof, by death, and then raising our nature in himself, into that everlasting righteous new covenant life, in which, for ever, justified The man Christ, thus by the right hand of God, exalted, and having received the promise of the Father, (or thing promised, even the holy ghost, or compleat life of his everlasting righteous creature-spirit) <hi>hath shed forth this</hi> sayes <hi>Peter, which ye now see and hear.</hi> Having received this promise of the Father, himself, he communicates it to them, also, as having rightly and obediently waited for it, according to his command, before his ascension; <hi>Act.</hi> 1, 4. So, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 10,-12. <hi>By the name of Jesus of Nazareth, whom ye crucified and God raised from the dead, does this man stand before you, whole.</hi> And by the same new name of his, in his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life, can any man ever stand or be found in perfect soundness, so as to be ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lastingly justified in Gods sight, and saved, <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Peter,</hi> in defence of that right power, and name, by which he had cured the impotent man, first, to the People <hi>(Act.</hi> 3.) and after, to the Council <hi>(Act.</hi> 4.) gives a full testimony to Christ, compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending the sum of all Gospel-preaching. He declares him to be that <hi>Jesus</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth,</hi> who was crucified in the changable first covenant life of the Law (in which he had been manifested) and raised, by the mighty power of God, into the everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing righteous new covenant life of the Gospel, and divine also. So, is the very man Christ, as exalted into the full possession of divine and everlasting creature-life, the compleat and comprehensive mystery of Godliness, in himself, and opener thereof, to others. He that was manifested in flesh, by being justified in spirit, becomes the manifester of his own divine and creature-spirits, and fellowship thereof, in

This is the unpardonable sining against the holy ghost; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. Gospel or spiritual light, gives a view or knowledg of Christ in his spiritual life, and of the terms and way of attaining it. All changable good, and all manner of evil, filth of flesh and spirit are to go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the death-blows of the spirit of the Cross, upon nature; and by the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-work of the same spirit into a newness of life, is unchangable goodness or everlasting righteousness set up in the room thereof. This cures all evil in man, and secures him, at length, from all sin or punishment, for ever. For a man, by Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-light, to have, in Prospect, these glorious advantages to himself, by submitting to the declared terms of entring into the New-covenant with God, by the sacrifice of all he was possessed of, in the old <hi>(Psal.</hi> 50. 5.) and turn from that light of truth, to the doctrine of the devil, is such aggravated folly and madness, as exceeds all words. By this wilful departure from God, and refusing so great salvation, shewed and offered them, do men judg themselves unworthy of everlasting life <hi>(Act.</hi> 13. 46.) and God judges them worthy of everlasting death, under his fiery indignation that shall devour all such wilful and incorrigible adversaries; <hi>Heb,</hi> 10. 26, 27. This Apostacy from Christ, is here declared to proceed from, and be occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sioned by mens giving heed to seducing spirits, and doctrines of devils; known by them, so to be. Doctrines of devils are such as Satan and his Instruments come forth with, in imitation of the highest spiritual Truths of Christ, on purpose to undermine and invalidate the same.

These things he attempts, even on true saints, and then accuses them to God, for such follies as, for a season, he has seduced them into, and that, under the blackest aggravations, imaginable, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke God to cast them off, and deliver them up, for ever, into his hands. Thus does he bestir himself, on all hands, to bring, if possible, the very elect, into the same de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction with himself. Yet, not one of these, will he ever be able to pluck out of the father or sons everlasting arms of mercy; <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. 28, 29. But the hypocrites in <hi>Sion</hi> (that would have the first covenant-life and righteousness of the Law, in their restored nature, passe for the new covenant life of the Gospel, in the spirit of grace) willingly give themselves up to these seducing spirits, and greedily drink in the doctrins of devils. So are they fetched off, from all faith, or regard to Christ, in his spiritual life, or any doctrine and words thereof. They are lodged up with satan, in his accursed, other Gospel, in perfect contrariety to Christ's, in every point. Never will this be more the case, never will professors so generally run after these doctrines of devils, or satans ministers have more thronged auditories, in a course of direct enmity to the Gospel-spirit and all its words, then when Christ is ready to come forth, therein. They hate Christ and all his Gospel-truths, and turn
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:206287:28"/> in their love, to the known doctrines of devils. And then, God will, in jugdment, strengthen their self-chosen delusion upon them, under these seducing spirits they turn to, that they shall firmly believe the very doctrines of devils, that they all may be damned, that believe not or obey the truth, in the love thereof; 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 11, 12. <hi>Es.</hi> 66, 4. Thus, seducing devils, wilful men, and the most righteous God, do, on differing accounts, all center in one and the same point, to lodge men in a combind, self-chosen interest, with devils, in unchangable enmity to God, and dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation to themselves, under the unchangable wrath of God. And all this dealing of God with them, will, at last, be made appear, undeniably righteous, in their own sight. Christ will waken up his Gospel-light in their consciences, by comming forth in the full brightnes and all-discovering cleerness thereof. And this will stop and silence all their mouths of iniquity, forcing them to see and own his wrath up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, to be as undeniably just, as irresistibly powerful, having wilfully turned from his known doctrine of truth, and given themselves up, to seducing spirits, and known doctrines of devils.</p>

But in litteral marriage, used as a Type of this first mystical marriage with Christ, all obligations are dissolved and made void, by the death of the Husband. Where the life on both sides is changable and mortal, this dissolution of the marriage, by death, must needs come to pass, by an invincible necessity, and as an inevitable

On the death or departure of the mystical as well as litteral husband, that relation ceases. Man is lawfully discharged from such obedience to Christ himself, as is performable in the life of the Law, or activity of his own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, therein, when Christ becoms dead to him, and is gone from him, refusing any longer, to perform the office of a husband, there. Christ now requires this first-covenant-wife, to follow his suffering steps into the same death, in order to be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to him, as another man, or the same, in another state of life, a Gospel life of everlasting righteousness, the life of the second Covenant, into which he has raised our nature, in himself, out of the death of the first.

True Saints, in conformity to Christ, become dead to the Law, by the obedient surrender and loss of that mortal first-covenant-life, in which once married to him, under the Law.

                        </gap>e;</hi> Rev 1 18. None but this other man, Christ himself, in another life, is it lawful for his deserted first-covenant-spouse, to be married to. Marriage-union with Christ, in the first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, makes but shadowy saints, in mans holy flesh <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>mage of the earthly; in the second, truesaints, in Gods holy spirit and Image of the heavenly. Both these marriages with, and means or communications from Christ, in a suital leness to the life of each co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, the devil forbidds and denies, in direct contradiction to Gods meaning in both. He will deny and hinder, as long as he can, a first-covenant marriage with Christ, in the life and righteousness of the Law. For this casts him out of his rule and dominion over man, in the dark polluted state of his nature. In this first mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage, are men bound, in love and obedience to Christ, as their fleshly bridegroom, to deny and suppress the vile affections and thoughts of the corrupt spirit of nature, yet hanging about them. But, when by Gospel-light, convincingly shewed, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Christ, in a more excellent state of life, and invited to a second marriage-union with him, therein; this marriage, with the kingdom-wine, living-bread, and never perishing meats, or communications from Christ, suited to nourish, edify, or build them up in that life, will satan oppose, to his utmost. He will leave no means unattem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pted, in the highest improvement of all his subtilty and power, to forbid and hinder men from such marriage and meats. For, these, if received, secure men for ever from him. In carrying on this design, will he magnify the first-marriage, to the utter exclusion of the second. So, speakes lies in hypocrisy, concerning both cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-lives, marriages and meats. He asserts the life and righteousness in the first,
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:206287:29"/> to be everlasting, as to <hi>Eve, Ye shall not die, at all.</hi> What, saies he, will ye part with a life, food, and clothing, received from Christs own hand, and return to the needy, and naked condition ye were born in, dead in trespasses and sins? Will ye, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all Christs pains and care about you, to make you a people of God, throw all up, and turn heathens, again? This does he urge, as the only apostacy, madness and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, they can be guilty of. Hereupon, he perswades them, both on the account of pleasing God, and doing good to themselves, in holding fast the priviledges and advantages they have experienced in that marriage-union with Christ, not to part with that life, and glory of their own nature therein, on any termes, or promises, whatsoever. Thus does he produce his strong reasons, endeavouring by the intice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and self-pleasing words of his serpentine wisdom, to argue and flatter them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same destruction with himself, in unchangable enmity to the infinite divine and everlasting righteous new covenant-life of Christ. He perswads them, not to part with their own righteousnes, in the life of the law, that he may render them, with himself, incorrigible enemies to the Gospel-life of Christ and God.</p>
                  <p>Thus does he labour to keep up the first-covenant-life (that is but a shadow, a fading flower and altogether vanity) in the heart, and love of man, in preference and direct opposition to the second, which is spirit, grace, substance, everlasting righteousnes and truth. This, which satan knowes to be the object of Gods everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delight and love, having his seal of approbation upon it, <hi>(Joh.</hi> 6. 27.) Is, for that very reason and cause, the object of his utmost malice, dislike and hatred. He favours not the things of God, in his spirit of grace, but things of man or angels, in the spirit of nature, in unchangable enmity to God. Enmity to God, and his gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-spirit, was the first sin of man; the losse of the righteous life of the law, the punishment thereof. When this lost life is restored again, by the redeemer, the dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wound that laid all mankind dead in sin, is healed. But the enmity still remains, untouched, under all the work of the Law, upon men, or fresh comming and setting up of the command or first-covenant life of the Law in them. That most dangerous disease is but only skinned over, hid and covered thereby. That root of all mystical uncleanesses, idolatries, spiritual wickednesses and abominations, is not plucked up, but strengthened thereby, as got into its strongest hold. As men and devils order the matter, the strength of this sin is the Law. Enmity to the Gospel-life and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousnes of God, is revived and strengthened by the righteousnes of man. The sin of enmity against the Gospel, takes occasion by the very righteousness of the Law, through mans folly and satans artifices, to destroy man; <hi>Rom:</hi> 7. 11. This sin against the Gospel, shewed it self most signally in <hi>Paul,</hi> when most eminent in the righteousness of the Law; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 6. <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 1. and 26. 9, 11. Never does man, with more masculine courage and irrefragable confidence oppose Gods holy spirit, then when eminent in his own holy flesh. If satan can fix and render man unchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in this enmity, he has done his work. Then, tis eternal death. Tis a state of bondage and death, while changable and curable, by the death-work of the cross on that righteous state of nature, in which, seated. When man is delivered out of the death of his nature, in trespasses and sins, this enmity yet, is another state of
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:206287:30"/> death, under the most fruitfull exercise of his restored first covenant life. Enmity to he Gospel-spirit of everlasting life, is a state of mystical, spiritual death. These are the sad circumstances of man, at best, in his own restored nature. So far yet, is he from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

And if satan can fix man, in a self love to his own restored wisdom and righteousness, the establishing him there, keeps him from ever entring into Gods righteousnes, or being saved. This enmity to God, lies, as dead, in man, while he is dead in trespasses and sins; but springs up afresh into a masculine vigour, activity and daring boldnes, on his revival into the life and righteousnes of the Law; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 8, 9. When man is revived into the life of the law, enmity to the life of the Gospel, revives in him, also. Man, in the heathenish or corrupt state of nature, dead in sin, can take no right cognizance of the first covenant saints quarrel against the second. A first covenant people of Christ were the self-confidents, that were hot for crucifying him. <hi>Pilate</hi> and his heathen party would have cleared their hands of the guilt. His blood be on our heads and on our children, said the other party. And <hi>Gallio</hi> the heathen Deputy of <hi>Achais,</hi> cared for none of those things.

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:206287:30"/> it in mens heads, that the same life, as restored by Christ, is not changable, but an established state of everlasting righteousnes. This establishing man in his righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, is the very design and workmanship of the devil, upon him. By this means, he marries men to himself, the prohibited other man <hi>(Rom.</hi> 7. 3) and by his evil-angel cal influence, renders them more fruitful and excellent in that first covenant-life, as established by his hand, therein, in unchangable enmity to God, and the second. And thence-forward, all their works of righteousnes, performances, and duties of worship, under his conduct and steerage, are brought forth and done to him. They are now in a sort of new and everlasting covenant with him, and so, in unchangable enmity to God. This is the latter end worse then their beginning. For when born dead in trespasses and sins, and enemies of God, this twofold death, in sin▪ and enmity, or filth of flesh and spirit, was curable: But now, incurable. They have delivered themselves up to the devil, for ever, to receive the indeleble character of his spirit of unchangable enmity to God, upon them. When Christ is departed, as a fleshly bridegroom, from first-covenant saints, in holy flesh, they never hear more of him, as a husband, unlesse they submit to the same death of nature, with himself in order to meet him, in the second, and be married to him as risen from the dead. If they look for a second husband in a first-covenant-life, that's the devil. When Christ has left them, to wither, decay, and die away, here, under his Gospel-cross, Satan offers to build them up again therein, if they'l but listen to his counsel. When he has brought his matters to this pass, and put his esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blishing hand upon them, then are they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And then a fourth lye followes; That he need never look after any other.

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:206287:31"/> not to be admitted the least countenance or hearing. Devils, above all things, forbid this Gospel-life, marriage, and meats, doctrines and truths. Of all this life and food, will they and their apostles speak all the lies and falshoods, imaginable. They'l gild over their first-creation vanities, and thrust them into the room thereof, calling them all by their names, spirit, grace, truth, regeneration, new name, and what not? All scripture-words, relating to the character of the true Gospel saint, will they clap upon the back of the unchangable enemies of Christ, Gospel, and all his saints, And then will they call true saints, blasphemers; as deceived with a phantasm, a meer nullity, a diabolical fiction, or humane imagination, an aery notion, without any thing of substance or reality in it. Thus do they advance satans trivial first crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion nothings, into the room, name, dignity and titles of Christs spiritual new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion all things; things eternal; and so labour to overthrow the faith of saints, therein.

So, the old serpent deafes them to the voice of all spiritual charmers, charm they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so wisely. All Christs Gospel-truths sound strangly and incredibly in their ears, like a chimaerical nothing. But satans Gospel is easy to be understood, and suted to the natural palate and temper of all mankind. So, he carries all before him. The whole world wonders after the <hi>Beast; Rev.</hi> 13. 3. His first covenant things, wisdom, glory, fruits, and works of righteousness, duties, performances, prayers, preachings, with his gilding transformations and spiritualizings of all, do so glister in mens eyes, gratify their will, and amuse their understanding, that they greedily receive all for Gospel, and wholly turn away their ear from the very Christ, the very Gospel, to the very devil, and his. Satans Gospel is calculated to natures pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, has no hard sayings, or frightful doctrine of the cross, in it. By his Gospel, man may remain on his own bottom, stand on his own feet, and in his own inlightend understanding and will (the principles of the law, the discerning and desiring powers of that life, in his own nature will and way) receive and do all, requisite for his salvation. By these steps and wayes of falshood, does he gain a world of people from Christ, after they have received a first covenant life, and also second-covenant light, by which, brought to see him, in his new-creation life, wherein of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to become a spiritual Lord and Husband to them. All this will satan do, more signally and dangerously then ever, in these later times. He will labour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the first marriage-union of men with Christ, but abundantly more solicitous will he be, to prevent the second; because that will wholly exclude his interest in them, and enable them to discover all his cabinet-counsels and intrigues, in his f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

But both covenant lives, and marriages with Christ therein, are to be received, in their order, first that thats natural, and after, that which is spiritual, with the meats and proper food of each, with thanksgiving.

But where this cannot be, as his after-game with men, will he use all wayes imaginable to prevail with them to set up themselves in the first covenant, against Christ in the second; and so, perfectly exclude Christ in his spiritual life, from being the Object of their faith. Thus, as a false friend to Christ and saints, in a first-covenant-life, does he act the part of an implacable enemy to the second. And all this does he, because (as the <hi>Aethiopick Version</hi> reads) he appoints men to contract an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full marriage-union with himself, in unchangable enmity to Christ, which is the utmost wickedness, he or they can be guilty of.</p>

Their accounting the first-covenant-life and state, wherein men and angels were set up,
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:206287:33"/> by the first-creation, a state of true blessedness, is the very foundation of all their blasphemies against God and the holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit, offering a state of everlasting righteousness and true blessedness, by a new creation. The unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable over-value, of what God has done for us, in our first-creation, causes not only an under-value, of the transcendently more excellent things he offers us, by a second, but an absolute rejection of them, as a fiction.

The second, by <hi>godliness that is profitable to all things.</hi> The insignificancy of sensual life and mans utmost labours therein, as to true happiness, discernable to all, engages us to search out a farther meaning of bodily exercise, here, discernable only by Gospel-light. <hi>Paul</hi> calls the whole natural man, with his living soul (or restored life of the first covenant law, wherein created) the <hi>natural body,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 44, 45. <hi>Bodily exercise</hi> then, does here signify the utmost labour of the whole man, in the principles of a righteous first covenant life. Nothing possible to be done in the active power of this, can ever make him truly happy. Passive obedience in it, even to the death thereof, under the cross, or demolishing work of the Gospel-spirit of Christ, is the best use he can make of it, and only way to be possessed of that life, in the active power whereof, only, it is possible to please God, or be sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. If man (after convincingly shewed the Gospel-life of truth as it is in Jesus, and thereby called to part with all his fading life and riches, to partake thereof) refuses the exchang-terms; his <hi>bodily exercise,</hi> thence-forward, is highly unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to him, being direct rebellion against the Lord, in compliance with the devil, and conformity to this world, in such religion and worship, as is managable in <hi>oldness of letter,</hi> against <hi>newness of spirit.</hi> Tis only the Gospel-newness of life, in which man can exercise his whole being, with true profit to himself, and accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleness to God <hi>Man in honour,</hi> at his best estate, in the fading life and Glory of his first creation, <hi>is but as the beasts that perish; Psal.</hi> 49. 12. He has no life in his immortal spirit or being, but what is as mortal, transient, and perishable, as the life of the brute beast, or meer sensual life of his own body. If he attain not a higher and better state, by exchange through death, then all first-covenant life, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and wisdom amounts unto, he will die as the fool <hi>(Ec.</hi> 2. 16.) and be in a far worse condition then a beast, through the immortality of his being. The wise and rich first covenant saint, with his holy flesh, will be stripped of all, and laid in an equality, for ever, as to that, with the fool or common sinner of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in the corrupt spirit of nature. All first covenant life, wisdom and riches, are as perish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and of as slippery a tenure, as bodly life and the outward riches thereof. Tis mans high concern then, to submit to Gods terms for attaining that life of true godliness, in the Gospel-spirit of Christ, which is profitable to all things. And for this, must he part with the life and wisdom of his own spirit, the form of godliness and righteousness of man, which is profitable to nothing, of moment; of no avail, in the most fruitful exercise of it, as to true blessedness. But the exercise of true godliness, in the spirit of Christ, <hi>is profitable to all things, having the promises of this life, and the life to come.</hi> Both these promises belong to them that exercise
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:206287:34"/> themselves unto true godliness; as having obediently given up and ceased from the exercise of their beings in a first covenant life and form of godliness, in order to live unto God, walk, and exercise themselves in the Gospel-spirit of Christ, and power <hi>of</hi> godliness. In this spirit and image of the heavenly, only, is any, a true godly man. This spirit will make man <hi>holy, as God is holy,</hi> and <hi>pure as Christ is pure,</hi> that is, unchangably. Those, that with <hi>Paul, bear the markes of the dying of the Lord Jesus,</hi> under the death-blows of the cross, on their nature, at best, have the promise of the father, the everlasting righteous life of Christs Gospel-spirit, quickened and set up in them, in this life, world, or state of their unchanged mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal body. These <hi>first fruits of the spirit</hi> in them, <hi>enable them to walk in the comfort of the holy Ghost, with joy unspeakable and glorious.</hi> And what they have of this spirit of the world to come, while yet in this, is, beside the present rich consolation of it, a prophetical pledg, and self-evidencing demonstration of more a coming, in the life or world to come, even the full blessing of this Gospel-life, to the compleating of their joy, and wiping off all tears from their eyes. True godliness then, has, and comprehends in it, the promised spiritual life of Christ, and comforts thereof, in this world, and fulness of it, in that which is to come.</p>

And on the same, did Christ himself endure contradictions and blasphemous reproaches, yea and death it self, from first covenant professors, in the form of godliness and righteousness of man, but enemies to the power of at and righteousness of God, in the second; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 2, 3.

And by all, suffered and done by him, in his variety of creature-nature, in the first and second covenant life thereof, is he, also, the saviour of all men, as a common and general benefit of his death in the former, under his own sacrificing hand, in the latter. By his obedient surrender of our nature, to death in the former, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chased the fresh gift of that life to others, that he crucified in himself. So is he a fountain set open for all, to cleanse them from filth of flesh, by setting up a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous first-covenant principle of life, desire, thought, and action in them. All men may receive this common and generall salvation, in the activity and light of their own wills and understandings. All that love not their chains and bondage, in the dark, polluted, shameful state of their nature, beyond the glory, righteousness, and honour thereof, receive this first benefit of Christs death; that sort of righteous life, he crucified in his own person. <hi>Specially of those that believe:</hi> That is▪ obediently submit to the tearms of receiving Christs Gospel life of everlasting Righteousness.

A spiritual Elder or Father in Christ, by himself appointed a teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ruler over his Church, is not to be rebuked by his hearers, as an equal. They are to treat him as a Father, in a dutiful subjection to, and owning him in his place and office.

And such Elders are to own them as spiritual Brethren, of the same birth extraction, family, and linage with themselves; the spiritual Seed and Off-spring of Christ. Yea, and as such, that by a farther growth in the spiritual knowledge of Christ, may attain the dignity of spiritual Eldership and Fatherhood, in the Church.

She is nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her wilderness-state of widowhood, by a food, secretly dispenced to her, and received by faith, through the mysterious opperations of the spirit of the cross, that devoures and takes away her natural life and food in the first-covenant, and, at same time, gives her a better food, in such secret ways, and by such means, as are not seen or understood by her self, during her widowhood as to the first, and before her actuall marriage, to Christ, in the second. Support she has, but what, or how, or whence, is a riddle to her own understanding. Thus was the desolate spirit of <hi>Job</hi> supported, all along his sore agonies under the amusing and not understood oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the cross. The saint, when deprived of visible, perishing food, is secretly supported with invisible, never-perishing meat, from the same hand that took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the other. And this is the thing that is good and acceptable before God. For so he has the whole praise, of his saints support, and the wants of their desolate widowhood are supplied by the food of another life, which nourishes them up, for a better marriage-union with Christ, then what he has forsaken them in, which will <hi>fill their heart with joy, and mouth with laughter,</hi> for ever.</p>

                  <p>Here's the Character of a contrary frame of mind, to that of the widow indeed, that in her desolate state, as to all the enjoyments and comforts of her first marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age-union with Christ, chastly waits for him in a second, refusing to be comforted in any thing, short of that. This contrary-minded widow, is convincingly shew'd and offerd Christ, as a spiritual husband, in another life, and call'd to the same house of mourning, under the dispensation of the cross, with the other. But, in enmity to the crosse, and hatred to Christ in his spiritual life, she loves that life, he has left; lives, delightes and takes pleasure in that. So, is dead to, and mindless of her true spiritual husband in his new, Gospel-life. She turns from all his counsels, and utterly despises him, therein. The want of a true chaste love to Christ, as her hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band in the first, is the cause of her refusing him, in his second and more excellent life. She loves the glory and advantages of her own nature, in the first: not his, in the second. Otherwise, in a like-mindedness and conformity to him, she would sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to the death of her nature, under his cross, in the first, in order to be married to him, in his second. What he has quitted, forsaken and parted with, she would do likewise. But, she takes pleasure in the former life, which undeniably shews, she loved him, while a husband to her there, not for his, but her own sake, as enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, beautifying and adorning her own nature. For, in his absence from, and known rejection of that first-covenant life, and total deserting of her therein, she still de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights in that, turns from him in the second, in love to herself in the first. The business of the cross, is to crucify this evil love, to the first. But, in perfect con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to his own exemplary practice, and command, she takes pleasure in the life, he is departed out off, calling her to follow him in his suffering steps, into the life, he is now in. In hatred to his person, in his own Gospel-life; and love to herself in her own law-life, her whorish mind and heart, turns to satan, who is rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy at hand, with his offers, to build her up again and establish her in the righteous

These qualifications and circumstances of the discreet, modest litteral widow, point out to us, the mystical, the natural man of the saint, deserted by Christ, and put under the sharp discipline of the cross, as to the first-covenant life thereof, wherein Christ was once a husband to her. But, ceasing from his husbandly influencings of them, there, they decline into a state of old Age, bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renes, and death. In this desolate state of mystical widowhood, and old Age, tis a mark of honour, to have been the <hi>wife but of one man.</hi> They rest and cease from the labours, not only of the body, as observers of a litteral <hi>Sabbath,</hi> do; but, of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural spirit, in a first-covenant life, in which it has performed its appointed six dayes labours, in order to keep the true mystical <hi>Sabbath-day,</hi> the true Lords-day, in that Gospel-spirit of his, in which he will judge the world, and in which God delights and rests, for ever. The mystical wants of such widows, are to be relieved by the Gospel-Church, with spiritual counsels and instructions, for their support. They return not in their love, to that life, Christ has forsaken them, in. The true widow, knowes, that would be a forsaking of her first love. She resolves therefore against a second marriage, in that life. She likes her widowhood, better than any second husband, there: <hi>Her house</hi> or state of <hi>mourning,</hi> then to return into the first-covenant <hi>house of feasting,</hi> where she knowes, she shall never meet with her first husband, more. She is well aware, that had it been her true concern, to remain in the said life, as her true blessedness, her first husband would never have left it. All Satans courtships and addresses to flatter her back, prevail not with her, for any lingring desires or love-glances, that way. She admits no treaties with this other man, the man of sin, that would woe her back into his worldly life and dominion. All the
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:206287:40"/> kingdoms of this world and glory of them, all humane and angelical, all visible or invisible excellencies, wisdom, righteousness, and glories, in the whole naturall, or first creation-world, can't bribe her off from her love to her first husband, in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother, more excellent life. Who ever she marry in the former life, that her first-husband has forsaken for ever, she knows, must be some other man. Into this snare of the devil, are all wanton, unchast mystical widows brought, to their certain and irrecoverable ruine. But the chaste widow observes the prohibition of Christs spiritual Law, for ever marrying another husband, in the life of the Law, her first is departed out of. She chastly waites her first husbands return to her, in a better life, though at present, experiencing nothing but barreness and want, in her desolate mystical widowhood and old Age. Such widows deserve the care of the mystical Deacons of Christ spiritual Church, the good Angels, who are charged to keep them, in all their wayes of obedience to Christ, as ministring spirits, sent by him, to minister for them, who shall be heirs of salvation; <hi>Psal.</hi> 91. 11. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 14. They minister and hand to them that living Manna, Angels bread, or never-perishing meats, suted to build them up into the everlasting, spiritual, Gospel-life of Christ, their true husband. Thus are these mystical poor and needy widows, nourished in the wildernes-state of their own barren and desolate nature (having no life, food or strength in a first covenant state, left them) till their true lord thinks fit to return to them, in a second, and take them into actuall marriage-union with him, there, by which they will be possessed of the unspeakable riches of his glorious person: This get they, by having quitted their own old life, name and will, to bear the new name, and live in the will of their spiritual lord and husband, for ever, in which only they can bring forth fruit unto God, offer up spiritual sacrifices of praise to him, and be truly blessed in their deeds, for evermore; 1 <hi>Pet</hi> 2. 5. <hi>Jame.</hi> 1. 25.</p>

                  <p>Here is a farther account of the qualification and duty of the literall widow, in reference to God, her own family and others. She is to be such a one, as has brought up her own children, in the fear of the Lord, and in their lawful and hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est callings, and so, has supplied that place of her husband, which she was called to, by his death, whence the whole care of them lies upon her, under God. She is also to be such a one as hath exercised the Law of common humanity; and peculiar love to saints, as so. If she have thus been diligent in all sort of good works, and in old Age reduced to poverty, she deserves the care and relief of the Church. Every of these qualifications of the literal, is typical, to what is to be found in the mystical widow, that is a widow indeed. <hi>She is to be well reported of for such good Works,</hi> as signify her faithfulness in passive obedience to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Such good works justifie or manifest her true faith in, and love to Christ in his spiritual life; as also kindnes to her mystical children, the births, fruits or works of her spiritual faith. And on the same account of love to Christ, is she ready to shew true kindnes to all saints, even such as yet are strangers and not brought into Christs spiritual fold, and univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sally, to all men in want, but chiefly to those that are in mystical affliction and pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Christs poor and needy, that are of a <hi>contrite heart, and broken spirit,</hi> as to all their own life, will, and strength. For this her demeanour, will Christ supply all her mysticall wants, out of his spiritual riches and abundance. The performance or non-performance of these offices of love to his poor and needy little ones, will Christ take exact notice of, at last, as the characters and marks, by which he will distinguish and sentence <hi>sheep and goats, to eternal life or death; Mat.</hi> 25. 31, 46.</p>

They resolve to deck themselves with the ornaments of that life, their husband, is departed out of, in order to be married to another man, in the same life again, which they know, by Gospel-light, will fix them in unchangable enmity to his spiritual life, in which offered to them, They put off the marks of their widowhood and badges of their mourning, under the demolishing blows of the cross (on that life in them, he is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted out of, and has abandoned them in) in order to be married again, in that, to the known unchangable enemy of Christ, in his more excellent, spiritual life. <hi>Job,</hi> after waken'd up into Christs spiritual light and life, acknowledged that in his confused thoughts and misprisions of Gods dealings and intents towards him (under the cross on his former righteous life and state) <hi>he had darkened counsel by words without knowledge, and said, he knew not what.</hi> But, he said and did all, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, as was <hi>Pauls</hi> case, in his blind zeal for his own life of the Law. <hi>Oh, said he, that I were as in the days of my youth,</hi> in the fruitful flourish of my own nature, in the life of the law, wherein I had an over-topping wisdom and super-eminency, and made the right and faithful use of it, <hi>in delivering the oppressed,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 29 1,—17. All this first-covenant life and wisdom, though most faithfully and rightly used, was Christ running down in <hi>Job,</hi> and stripping him of all his glory and orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments therein, under the dispensation of his cross. At length, he abhorrs all that he had so doted on, in comparison of what he received from the same hand, in a more excellent state and way; <hi>Job.</hi> 42. 3, 6. So, <hi>Paul</hi> counted all, dung and loss, in the first, for the knowledg and experience of Christ, in the second. But these widows that wax wanton against Christ in the second, turn back in their love to the first, and so to satan, who stands ready to gratify and embrace them, therein. So, he finds it an easy task, to fix them, with him, in the first, in unchangable enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to Christ, in the second. <hi>He takes them alive</hi> thus, in the life of the first-covenant,

He charmes and lulles them into such a dead sleep towards Christ in his spiritual life, as to render them wholly mindless of any such thing, for ever after, save only to resist and oppose it and all the right words thereof. They become his champions and most gigantick opposers of all Gospel-truth. The true saint is content to have this foe of his own house, or in his own person, that can joyn with satan in unchangable enmity to Christ, wholly taken down and extinguished in all the life and desire of it, by the Cross, and then all is safe. The wicked one finds no part, in him. But, the wanton widow, that turns away from Christ in his spiritual life, in love to her former state, by him deserted, satan presents all advantages she can desire, to her own nature. He offers to build the mystical Barns, or House thereof, greater; that is, widen her natural capacity, to receive his superiour, angelical excellencies, beyond what she ever experienced under Christ, himself, in the same first-creation life, while a Husband to her, there. He will furnish her with the wisdom and tongue of angel as well as man, a dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of intuitive discerning and expression, as well as organical conception and a sound of words; but all, in unchangable enmity to Christ; nothing of his Gospel-spirit, that's called <hi>Love,</hi> in her.

So satan bites her mortally, and steals his serpentine poyson into her, as, prostituting herself to him, in a mind of whordom and unchangable enmity against her true Lord and Husband. The death, Christ offers by his Gospel-Cross, to bring upon this widow, as to the life of the Law; the devil out of his bottomless pit of deceits, represents as the greatest wrong, imaginable, to her, even a plucking up of all her hopes of salvation, by the roots. He tempted Christ himself, <hi>to pitty and spare himself,</hi> on this account, as to the first-covenant-life of the Law, he was born in. The womanish natural spirit in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> was thus deceived by him: but the manly new-creature-spirit of the second, could not be deceived into the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression of Gods spiritual Law. No man, in the highest, single, first-covenant-wisdom, receives Christs Gospel-testimony of the second; <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 32.

The wanton widows disloyalty to her spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Lord and Husband, by mystical whordom and adultery with the devil, once compleated, all the children, or fruits brought forth by her, in that unlawful mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage-union with him, are children of whordoms, though of the same hiew and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion, to mans judgment, as the fruits she brought forth to Christ, when a husband to her in the said first-covenant-life.

On this, the damnation they bring up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their own heads, by such aggravated folly, is undeniably just. Both Christ and their faith in him, are utterly cast off, by them. He has, for ever, forsaken them in the first covenant-life, and they, him, in the second; so are they never like to meet with, or see him, more, but to their sore disadvantage. For they are found, with devils, in unchangable enmity to that spirit of their true husband, in which he will judg the world. So, the eternal mystical death of their immortal spirits and whole beings, is inevitable, under the unchangable wrath of him that offered unchangable love, to them. And this final damnation, we shall find them yet more justly deserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, by the farther account, here given, of their unworthy practices. <hi>When they have cast off their first faith,</hi> and so, Christ himself, their offered spiritual lord and hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, <hi>they do withall, learn to be idle, wandring about from house to house.</hi> This practice, in letter, renders them that so do, a despicable and unworthy sort of People. And, much more despicable does it render these mystical wanton widows. For this <hi>idleness and wandring from house to house</hi> is a true character of their lewd and whorish frame of spirit, against Christ, that calls them to abide at home with himself, and not gad abroad, in their love, after first-creation-vanities, or any other lovers. But they wander <hi>from house to house</hi> in lewdness and idleness, seeking where and with whom to satisfy their lustfull, whorish mind, in all sorts of spiritual uncleaness. Of this, we find an account, in the Lords charge against his first-covenant <hi>Israel, Ezek.</hi> 16. 32, 34. Here is an exact, lively description of these wanton widows, who (when Christ offers himself to be a husband to them, with his durable riches of eternal life) from <hi>their weak and foolish, but imperious whorish heart (Vers.</hi> 30.) in stead of taking Christ, with his unspeakable gifts in the second, they give up all his gifts and ornaments, in a first-covenant life, and second covenant light (figuratively signified by Corn, and Wine, Oil, Silver, and Gold) to <hi>Baal</hi> or the devil; <hi>Hos.</hi> 2. 8. So do they hire evil Angels, strang lovers, Christs unchangable enemies, to satisfy their adulterous desires, in mystical whordom. <hi>And not only idle, but tattlers also, and busy-bodies, speaking things, they ought not.</hi> This yet shews more unworthiness in them. They betray, reveal, and discover the secrets, their true husband trusted them with. They deliver up his spiritual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>victions (the mystical spies, that gave a true report of the excellent and desireable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of his new creation land or state of life, to them) into the hands of his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>implacable
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:206287:42"/> enemies. So do <hi>they speak</hi> and declare <hi>things, they ought not.</hi> In hatred, scorn and derision to him, do they tattle, in an overly, slight, notional way, concerning his spititual truths and things, by him discovered to them, rejecting and trampling them under their feet, in the very manner of their speaking of them. And their false lovers joyn with them, in casting contempt upon Christ, and all his offers. In and by all this, do they give a firm assurance and satisfying testimony to the devil, that they have for ever cast off their faith in, and all their former love and obedience to Christ, to joyn with him in unchangable enmity against him.</p>

                  <p>Heres aduice, for preventing the evils and dangers, incident to the younger widows. In pursuit of the mystical intendment of this whole scripture, about widows, the marriage here, young widows are to be put upon, is a speedy entring the second marriage-union with Christ, in his Gospel-spirit and life of everlasting righteousnes, as a new root and spring of all their desire, thought, and action. This Gospel-principle is the only certain preventer of the marriage, in whordom, above charactred, and of all the evil practices, therein, with the mischiefs and dangers that inevitably follow. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore declares it his will and adv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce, in the infallible spirit and authority of Christ, that <hi>the younger widows, marry.</hi> These widows are such as had been married to Christ in the first covenant, but deserted, for ever, by Christ there, so never to be married therein, more, unto any. That's the prohibited marriage, all along. Christs first-covenant spouses, do not immediatly on his departure from them, there, receive such a discernable dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution and decay of the glory and fruitfulness of that life, as to make them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently aware of his new dispensation. by the cross, towards them. So are they in a dangerous propensity, through mistake, to receive another husband, that will impregnate and render them fruitfull there, according to their former experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, under Christ himself. This young, newly made widow, on Christs desert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, in the first marriage, is not to be flattered into a false comfort and hopeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, as to Christs ever returning to her, more, there, but forthwith instructed and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to wait for his return to her, in another spirit and life. She is also to be speedily informed of the only way and means, and exhorted to submit to the terms (seem they never so hard) of being married to Christ, in that other life. For in that new life, he will be an abundantly better husband and comforter to her, and she bring forth abundantly more and better fruits, then in the former. Sins of all sorts can recover and exercise dominion over her, after her marriage-union with Christ himself, <hi>under the Law,</hi> or in a first-covenant-life: <hi>But under grace,</hi> when married to him, in the second, all his safe; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 14. The Gospel-spirit or principle of life and action, secures from all danger. Young, newly made widows, by Christs departure from them, are apt to reckon satans pleasing offers to them of keeping them up in the fruitful exercise of that life, Christ has deserted
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:206287:42"/> them in, a return of Christ himself to them, after a temporary desertion, for then triall; whereas he is departed for ever from them, as to that state. Satan finds it no uneasy matter, in this case, to passe with them, for Christ himself. <hi>David</hi> prayed for, and found Christs steady, <hi>constant spirit</hi> of everlasting righteousness his only security from all sorts of uncleanness, litteral and mystical, <hi>all filth of flesh and spirit,</hi> too; <hi>Psal.</hi> 51. 10. No security in the first covenant, from either. Those that fall into satans armes, for managing them in first covenant principles and life of the law, he will indulge them the liberty of returning into <hi>filth of flesh,</hi> also, and that, as the true Christian liberty, allowed them by Christ. This is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>antism. Satan abuses Christs assertion, that Publicans and Harlots stand less prejudiced against the kingdom of God and right doctrine thereof, then first cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant professors, in holy flesh. Satan hence argues, that the righteousnes of man is a greater obstruction to true happines, then common, gross wickednes. So turns Christs own saying, into an argument to run men back again into fleshly polluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The mystical young widow, as the only preventive of all this mischief, is to be exhorted speedily to submit to Christs way of taking down and spoiling all her first-covenant life, glory and comelyness, by his cross, as her due and right pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification for a new marriage-union with him, in that spirit, which will secure her from <hi>all filth of flesh, and spirit,</hi> too, for ever. She ought, in this case, to own the friendly wounds of Christ, her true husband, on all her former life and delights, rather then the kisses or flatteries of satan, the unchangable enemy of Christ and her, that offers to keep her up in the fruitful exercise of that life, Christ comes to pull down and destroy, as the only way, for her entring into an everlasting union with him. When fixed in this second marriage with Christ, the other things, here required, will follow, as certain fruits therof. For, so will this first-covenant widow of Christ become the happy <hi>Mother of many Children,</hi> or fruits and works of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes, in the second; and will be a fit guide to her whole mystical house or person, in all the parts and powers thereof, in the gospel-spirit of her lord and husband, so as to take away all occasion of reproach to her gospel-principle, and profession of Christ, therein. By her willing <hi>conformiiy to Christ, in his death,</hi> the lusts of the youthful natural spirit are crucified, by which she was exposed to the tempter and liable to run into such spiritual uncleanness, idolatryes, and abominations (if not also litteral) as expose her and her gospel profession of Christ, her true spiritual hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, to all manner of reproach, from the adversaries of herself and him. 'Tis the strength of her natural desire, gives all the power against her, to world and devil. That, weakened, disables those enemies, in their practicings upon her, and when fully crucified and dead, all their tempting and alluring power towards her, expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>res and wholly ceases. The most charming desireables in Satans worldly dominion, are crucified to her; when she, to them. Till then, this second marriage-union with Christ be firmly contracted in the life he is risen into, (through her <hi>conformity to him in the death</hi> and loss of all he was a first husband to her in) She is in danger, by mystical whordom, of giving the greatest <hi>occasion</hi> imaginable, <hi>to the enemies of the Lord to blasphem,</hi> if not also by literall, as in <hi>David</hi> case, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 14. The
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:206287:43"/> very adversary that tempts her to such evil, will be the first accuser and reproacher of her, for it. This is the mystical widows danger, if she follow not the Apostles advice, for a speedy entring the second marriage-union with Christ, in his gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousnes. Her absolute security from all evils, dangers, enemies, and reproaches, can be had in nothing short of this, which therefore she ought to use all possible expedition, in.</p>

Tis all one uniform work and thing, however unperceived, or unconsidered. Christ himself, with all his true prophets, and apostles, have been thus handled by a fleshly <hi>Israel,</hi> or first-covenant saints, among <hi>Jew</hi> or <hi>Gentile.</hi> The first-covenant spirit, corrupting and sowring into an enmity against the second, is the same <hi>leaven</hi> in our gospel-day with that <hi>of the Pharisees,</hi> in their law-day. The higher dispensation, we are under, aggravates the sin. The apostles, sent by Christ, when a fleshly bridegroom to them, in the first-covenant life, were rewarded for their ministry, by men. But when sent by him, in his Gospel-spirit <hi>(Act.</hi> 2.) They soon found the case altered, receiving nothing but blows, as Christ had forwarned them. For, now they'l be reckoned the most criminal transgressors, with him, even by such, as before gave them friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly entertainment; <hi>Luk.</hi> 22. 35, 37. A right Gospel-ministry preaches death to man, in the most righteous-life of the law. This is reckoned <hi>a blaspheming</hi> or evil-speaking <hi>of the Law, Moses and God, as Steven</hi> was served, <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 11. 13. Though Christ and his Apostles did miraculously heal the bodies of men, this did not secure them and their disgustful Gospel-doctrine, from persecution. First co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant zelots will on, in their persecuting enmity, even against Christ himself, putting him to death, that they knew raised another from the dead. At this rate, Gospel-preachers are to expect to be dealt with, in this confounded world, under the permitted rule of the devil, and his instruments of all sorts, amongst men. As soon as <hi>Saul,</hi> a legal-spirited persecutour, became <hi>Paul</hi> a Gospel-preacher, he was presently persecuted at <hi>Damascus,</hi> whither he went to persecute, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32, 33. and <hi>Act.</hi> 9. 23, 25. Men love, with <hi>Ahab,</hi> to be soothed up by false prophets, which are many, but hate and persecute the true <hi>Micaiahs,</hi> who are very few, one to a multitude. The false are highly rewarded; the true, imprisoned and persecuted.

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> here, in one particular, shews the great reverence, due to both teaching and ruling Elders, in the gospel-Church, from true Saints. <hi>No accusation is to be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> against them, <hi>unless</hi> attested <hi>by two or three witnesses,</hi> for the proof therof. For this, the witnesses must be such, as render the evidence by them given, undeniable. So much of the litteral sense of these words. In the mystical, or spiritual, the two or three witnesses, whose testimony alone does make good a charge against such Elders, for any wrong word or action, must be the same, whose joynt testimony does ratify and establish every right word or action in their gospel-ministry and rule; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 1. Who are these? Christ himself, and his Father. <hi>Thou bearest record of thy self, thy record is not true, said the Pharisees</hi> to Christ. <hi>If I bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes of my self,</hi> in the single spirit of the law, that I am therein the light and life, that's eternal salvation to men, my witness is not true; <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 31. <hi>But, there is another heareth witness of me, the Father that sent me.

<pb n="87" facs="tcp:206287:45"/> harmony with the spirit of the Gospel, and the Father himself, with whom that spirit is in unchangable harmony. I <hi>know whence I came, and whither I go,</hi> saies Christ; ye, neither. <hi>He came out of the</hi> spiritual <hi>Glory, he had with the Father,</hi> into the worldly, first covenant life of our nature. And into that, he returns with our nature, through the death thereof; <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 4, 5. This heavenly creature-life, he came from, and returned into, the <hi>Pharisees</hi> knew not, or owned. And this was the very thing, he witnessed, even in the first covenant life. So, <hi>his record</hi> therein, <hi>was true. These things, I say,</hi> said he, <hi>that ye might be saved.</hi> I witness, in my life of the law, that the light of life, which is everlasting salvation, is to be had only in the everlasting spirit of the Gospel, by following my suffering steps, into the death of that state, ye now see me in. In his first covenant life, he gave testimony to himself, in the second, as <hi>John</hi> Baptist also did, <hi>Jo.</hi> 8. 12,-18. And <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 30, 37. By the mystical fire of his gospel-spirit, kindled on the earth of our fleshly nature at best, in the life of the law, in himself and followers, does, he raise it, in both, and all, into the everlasting life of that sacrificing priest. The spirit of the law then, in its spiritual and full testimony to the Gospel, with the new-creature, Gospel-spirit it self, and infinite divine, are <hi>three witnesses,</hi> that give a firm and unquestionable testimony to every right Gospel-word of teaching Elders, and against every word of mans and Satans other Gospel. <hi>I am not alone,</hi> said Christ to the <hi>Pharisees, but I and the Father that sent me. My Judgment therefore is true▪</hi> Christ, in our fleshly nature, declares himself, to be in union with his Root and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the infinite divine, and infallible new creature spirit of truth. So, in the life of the law, he spoke the mind of his divine Father, and infallible Gospel-spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; that nature, at best, in the changable life of the law, must, in himself and followers, passe, by way of death and resurrection, into the everlasting righteous life of his Gospel-spirit. The infinite divine essence, or Father to Christ's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensive person, (consisting of the infinite divine form and supream creature-image of God) does testify him, in his new creature-spirit, to be his <hi>only begotten Son, in whom he is well-pleased.</hi> By partaking of this infallible creature-spirit of truth, <hi>Paul</hi> became a preacher of the Gospel, and had, therein, the concurring testimony of all the abovesaid three witnesses, to all his right Gospel-words, <hi>which were</hi> only <hi>yea;</hi> and not as the words of mans fallible wisdom, which are <hi>yea, and nay,</hi> off and on, as a fit character of that dictatour; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 17, 20. In the high authority of the said three witnesses, do true Gospel Elders preach Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truths. No accusation then is to be received against them, as preaching false doctrine, but by such as can make good their charge, in a self-evidencing harmony with these 2 <hi>or</hi> 3 <hi>witnesses.</hi> If the highest single, self-confident wisdom of man, made wise by Christ, in but the restored first covenant life of the Law, charge them with false doctrine; no evidence given against them in that Spirit and wisdom, is to be taken as proof. That wisdom in millions of men, is no fit witness or judge in the case. All the thoughts and words of that <hi>wisdom, are foolishness to the</hi> Gospel <hi>words and wisdom of God,</hi> and God's to that. If men, made <hi>wise, strong, and honourable by Christ,</hi> in first-covenant life and wisdom, undertake to be judges of all truth, <hi>Paul</hi>
                     <pb n="88" facs="tcp:206287:46"/> and all true Gospel-elders, with all their words, are gone, as <hi>weak, foolish, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spicable,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10.</p>
                  <p>For all divine and spiritual Gospel-things or truths, lie cleare out of the reach of that wisdom, shut up in an absolute invisibility from that sort of understanding. You assert and declare, but how do you prove it, that is, evidence to our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that what you say, is Gospel-truth? Man, herein requires an absolute impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, in perfect contradiction to the very letter of scripture, which asserts, that that kind of understanding, in which they demand proof, can never take the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. All the <hi>deep things of God, and unsearchable riches of Christs person,</hi> all Gospel-things and truths, that are obvious to spiritual wisdom, are foolishnes to the <hi>wise, strong and honourable</hi> first-covenant saint. in his holy flesh, or righteousness of man, who yet is but within the sphere and compass of nature, the natural man, that can not receive the things of God, or his Gospel-spirit; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10, 15. There is no medium or argument, by which tis possible to conveigh the actuall sight of divine and spiritual truths, to natural understanding. The letting fall all that wisdom and understanding in the first-covenant state, under the crosse of Christ, as the very <hi>partition-wall</hi> between them and all such most concerning truths, is undispensably necessary to their becoming wise, in the second. And so, all will be seen by them. <hi>The wise in this world,</hi> or worldly first-covenant life of his own nature, <hi>must be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a fool, that he may be wise,</hi> in the second.

And himself, with the whole Gospel-council at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem,</hi> had, in the holy Ghost, decreed, the quitting all former distinction between <hi>Jew</hi> and <hi>Gentile,</hi> under the dispensation of the Law, <hi>Act.</hi> 15. The superiour Gospel-state, life, and dispensation, intitled Gospel<hi>-Gentiles,</hi> to a nearer alliance and bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood with Gospel<hi>-Jews,</hi> then their own country-men, in the single life, spirit, and ceremony of the Law. For such were the fiercest enemies and persecutors of the Gospel-brotherhood, both amongst <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. Paul</hi> saw other Gospel<hi>-Jewes, carried away, by Peters example,</hi> in that unwarrantable practice; So, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buked the ringleader in this evil and errour, <hi>openly, before them all,</hi> for seperating from the Gospel-Gentiles, contrary to his own former practice, signall warning, and certain knowledg. <hi>Paul</hi> had the abovesaid 2 or 3 infallible witnesses on his side, authorizing him for that charge or accusation, against <hi>Peter,</hi> for the just Gospel-rebuke of him that was an Apostle and teaching Elder in Christ, before him; yea, when he was a persecutour of the Gospel. <hi>Peter,</hi> without any reply or apology, silently submitted to this just reproof, and obediently returned to his former Gospel-practice, with those he had misled by his faulty example. In such important cases, even teaching Gospel-Elders are to be roundly and freely dealt with, publickly <hi>rebuked before all, that others also may fear.</hi> Such rebuke is necessary, to keep others from the like fault, against Gospel-light. But should a Gospel-Elder, or any spiritual-saint (as to his words or walkings) be judged in any other then the Gospel-spirit of infallible truth (which implies and takes in the other witnesses that make up the two or three) he would be justified in his Gospel-crime, and condemn'd for all his words and walkings according to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. If the wisdom or spirit of man at best, be admitted judge in the Case, thus it would certainly be. But the true Gospel-Elder or any other inferiour Gospel-Saint, findes the wounds of a true Gospel-friend, on just occasion, better than the flattering kisses of the deceitful enemy of the Gospel and him, the fleshly mind in himself or others.</p>

For if they prove unmeet for such office, it will reflect disparagement, on that infallible spirit, in which Gospel-Elders pretend to make their judgment of such persons, before the laying on of their hands, as a Gospel Ordinance; <hi>Act.</hi> 6. 6. In this sence, this advice seemes to look back, to <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. 6, against the making such <hi>a novice,</hi> a Church-Elder, as may <hi>be lifted up with Pride, and fall into the condemnation of the devil.</hi> Such mistake would indeed evidence, they made not their judgment of such persons, in Christs infallible Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-spirit, but their own private natural spirit, which judges not as God judges, Even <hi>Samuels</hi> hasty humane judgment was reproved, when he looked on <hi>Eliab,</hi> the eldest son of <hi>Jesse,</hi> as the man designed by God, for King of <hi>Israel;</hi> Saying, <hi>surely the Lords annointed is before him. Look not on his countenance or height of his stature, sayes God. I have refused him. I see not as man sees. Man lookes on the outward appearance; I, on the heart.</hi> Six other sons are presented before <hi>Samuel,</hi> and all refused. At length <hi>David,</hi> the youngest of all, is fetched from the Sheep; <hi>Arise, annoint him, sayes the Lord, this is he, a man after my own heart,</hi> as having my own spirit of infallible truth in him (1. <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 6, - 13.) <hi>By which he spake,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam:</hi> 23. 2. This example shews, that even those who are furnished with the light and wisdom of Gods spirit, having yet something of their own uncrucified fleshly or natural mind, about them, are liable to mistake, and make a wrong judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of persons and things. And so come they to <hi>partake of other mens sins,</hi> as shar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the guilt of such unmeet persons failings in the office, to which by them ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. In another sense of this scripture, the Apostles advice may seem to import, that though Gospel-teachers are to witness against all sin, in all men, yet should they <hi>not lay hands suddenly on any man,</hi> that is, not come forth in the rash, hasty
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:206287:48"/> zeal, incident to the natural spirit, but in the self-evidencing wisdom, gentleness and meekness of the spirit of Christ, for the rebuking sin, in any. This is the only way to prevent their partaking of other mens sins, as they will, if they witness not against all sin, and that in a right spirit and manner, with all meekness; that is, in the gentleness of Christ's, not zeal and wrath of their own spirit. For this will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them guilty, as well as those they reprove. The wisdom and <hi>wrath of man ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> teaches, or works, <hi>commends</hi> or sets forth <hi>the righteousness of God,</hi> Jam. 1. 20. Gospel-Elders will thus contract a guilt, by their undue manner of reproving o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that are guilty.</p>

                  <p>Not denying a litteral sense, relating to the frailty of <hi>Timothy</hi>'s Body; 'tis sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly lawful to enquire into the spiritual things or mystical truths, figured by litteral shadows, here, as in other Scriptures. Water in Scripture doth represent the first-covenant-life and spirit, with the things thereof, as of a weak, changable, fluctuating and unstable nature; and so in the effects and products of it, in man. It cleanses from <hi>filth of flesh,</hi> but does not, at all, cure the sore disease of enmity against God, and his Gospel-spirit, which is filth of Spirit. This still remains as a mortal sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and infirmity in the stomack, mind, or inward parts. So far is restored first-covenant-life, from giving or being <hi>truth in the inward parts,</hi> which God requires <hi>(Psal.</hi> 51. 6.) that it harbours in it, falshood and enmity towards God. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy</hi> no longer feed and gratify his nature in that watery, unsteady first-covenant-spirit and life, that does but skin over and hide this evil disease of enmity to God. It must be a better than that life and righteousness of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees,</hi> that can intitle any man to the Kingdom of God. They were, in all that, the most signal enemies of Christs Gospel-spirit, and Kingdom.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Paul</hi> advises <hi>Timothy</hi> to drink no longer water, the fading reliefs of this unstable
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:206287:48"/> natural spirit, but of the Kingdom-wine of Christ, for the comforting and strength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening him in spiritual, Gospel-life. This is the only curer of all diseases of sin and enmity, the only <hi>cleanser of all filth of flesh and spirit,</hi> that will give a perfect sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, a spiritual stomack, or sound appetite to Christs never-perishing meats, and living <hi>Manna, the bread</hi> or food <hi>of</hi> Elect <hi>Angels.</hi> This will render him thriving in the Grace of God, and cause him to <hi>encrease with the encreases of God,</hi> till he come to his appointed full stature of spiritual manhood, in the Gospel-life of Christ. Those that deny this new-covenant, Gospel-life and wine of the Kingdom, leave no advance possible for, or incident to men, beyond and above the life they were first created in (which was, and when restored by the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is, intrinse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally and essentially changable and unstable as water) unless God should advance them into his very divine Life, and make them down-right Gods. A heavenly and everlasting righteous creature-life, man is capable of being advanced into. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding glory and earthly image of God, in the first-created state of angel or man, are not advanced into the unchangable image and glory of God, in the heavenly creature-life of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> but are to passe away from both, by their death therein, to make room for the heavenly, in and upon them. Man and Angels were <hi>made glorious,</hi> in their pure naturals, by the first-creation. But <hi>that glory is to be done away, as no glory to the second,</hi> that incomparably <hi>excells it, and remains for ever,</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 10, 11. A state of perfect soundness, health, and everlasting salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is attainable only by drinking spiritual, Kingdom-wine. Man, in his primitive purity, before tainted with any sin or enmity against God, was in no security as to attaining Christs new-creation wine or life, or keeping his own fading old-creation-water of a first-covenant-life. This is evident by the irrecoverable fall of many angels in their own persons; and recoverable fall of all men, in and with the first. But men, actually recovered out of their fall, and <hi>death in trespasses and sins,</hi> into the life of the first <hi>Adam,</hi> by the death of it, in the second; if they sin against the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-life of the second, <hi>after the similitude of the first</hi> Adams <hi>transgression,</hi> in their own <hi>persons,</hi> they become <hi>trees twice dead,</hi> and as irrecoverably gone, as the evil Angels. <hi>No place</hi> or room, <hi>is left for their repentance or change of mind; Esau</hi>'s Case, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 17. Man, the second time (after all warnings and experience of the dreadful consequents of the first sin) exalting the fading life of his own nature, by the first-creation, against the everlasting righteous creature-life, offered in Christs Gospel-spirit, by a second; by this self-exalting pride, he falls into the same final condemnation with the Devils, or evil Angels, out of all compass or reach of the benefit of Christs sacrifice or intercession. His knowing wilful enmity and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spite to the Gospel-spirit of grace, is the sin unto eternal death, that, nor Christ, nor saints are to intercede about, or pray for those they know guilty of; 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16.

                  <p>Here's a sad truth, relating to the incorrigibly wicked, of all sorts, litteral or mystical; as in the following Verse, a joyful one, relating to the truly, or unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably righteous. Of the former, 'tis here said, <hi>The sins of some of them are open</hi> or manifest <hi>before-hand, going before unto judgement;</hi> or, as the <hi>Arabick;</hi> to their <hi>damnation.</hi> These are the sins of such presumptuous sinners, as live in all manner of open vileness and pollutions, with litteral <hi>Sodom,</hi> that the common light of nature (in themselves and all others, restor'd by him <hi>that lighteth every man that comes into the world)</hi> condemns them for. A resolute giving themselves up to these <hi>vile affections,</hi> and lowest fort of lusts and pleasures, common to brute beasts, provokes <hi>God to give them up</hi> to them, also, according to their desire. And then their seared and benummed Consciences, cease, in great measure, to witness for God, against themselves. Hereupon, Hell breaks loose in them, and away they run, into the exorbitant brutalities, and gross uncleannesses of flesh, like a raging Sea, casting up nothing but mire and filth, in all manner of debaucheries, <hi>running <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And <hi>Jude</hi> vers. 7. demonstrate.</p>
                  <p>The Eternal fire of Gods unquenchable wrath upon them, was typed by the material fire from Heaven, on their litteral habitations and bodies. Such sinners have little more then the name or outward shape of men. Their manly, rational powers, that should rule their female, sensual powers, truckle under them, and in a serviceableness thereto, prog and lay about, to fetch in provisions, to gratify and fulfill the lusts thereof. So, the bestial powers, bearing rule in their perverted na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, turned upside down (on which, they are hurried, in the unbridled and uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trolled exercise of their bruitified wills) they may, from the ruling part in them, be, fitly enough, denominated Beasts. The man is gone. He has lost his power and rule. This sort of sinners carry Damnation, legibly written in their fore-heads. Their daring-presumption is sure to meet with a sad reckoning at winding up, from the undeniable righteous sentence, and irresistible righteous hand of God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them. Their short scene of brutish pleasure, in the lowest and most contempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble sort of vanities (the crummes that fall from Satans table, the gratifying satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions of the lowest appetites in man) will be paid home with, and end in, an eternity of woe and misery, beyond all conception or expression by the understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tongue of man or Angel. But Satan has other gets diet then this, upon his table, for a higher sort of his subjects, righteous men, in holy flesh, cleansed from the fore-mentioned pollutions of the corrupt nature. He has that by him, that will fully answer and gratify their appetite and palate. And this will he do (if God permit) as his only way, to seduce and keep them off, from Christs new-co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:206287:49"/> table and his never-perishing meats, his spiritual, everlasting <hi>feast of fat things, and wine</hi> of the Kingdom, signifying the divine and new-creature glories of Christ and God, joyntly shining forth upon blessed Saints and Angels, in favour and love. <hi>In</hi> such, <hi>their presence, is fullness of joy.</hi> Satan was as it, to prevent Christs carrying our nature, in himself, to his heavenly table, by offering him all the fading glories and excellencies of his first creation-kingdom or world. God has permitted him, with his evil Angels to keep up and make use of all the first-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion life, glory, wisdom and excellencies of their Angelical nature (in which, su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious to humane, at best) as turned into unchangable enmity to God, and the second. By this means, are they fitted and furnished, to countenance, gratify, and please first-covenant Saints, in holy flesh, <hi>with more than their hearts can wish,</hi> by communicating their superiour Angelical glories and wisdom to them, in order to lodg them, with themselves, there, in unchangable enmity to God. And thus does Satan make them the highest ranke of his loyal subjects and darling friends, in union of mind with him, to oppose the Gospel-spirit and Kingdom of Christ. In distinction from the abovesaid daring presumptuous sinners (indulging their polluted nature in its brutish liberties, and noisom Lusts, which sink them into everlasting per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition and destruction) here are another sort of sins and sinners, that are called, in scripture, <hi>hidden works and workers of dishonesty and darknes.</hi> This mysterious sort of sinners, in the <hi>form of Godlines,</hi> will be found guilty of spiritual uncleanesses, adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries and Idolatries, in enmity to the power thereof, in a fixed union of mind with the Devil. This latter sort of sinners against Christ, and most usefull subjects of Satan. passe <hi>in mans day,</hi> or judgment of his best and highest wisdom, for the only Saints and visible Church of Christ, who throw Christ himself and all his true Gospel-Saints out of their Church, as blasphemous wranglers about the inheritance, or kingdom of God, and wanderers from all Gospel-truths. But, in the infallible light of Christ Gospel-spirit, and Gods day of Judgment, therein, all Satans and mans Cheat will out, and be discovered. Then will this hidden sort of <hi>workers of Iniquity</hi> be found the most criminal sinners of all, and accordingly dealt with▪ Gross, open sins, and prophanness in the corrupt spirit of nature, <hi>Go before men into Judgment, as manifest before-hand,</hi> to all men.</p>
                  <p>But these <hi>hidden works of darkness</hi> (all manner of <hi>spiritual wickedness,</hi> under the <hi>form of godliness, and fair shews in holy flesh,</hi> against Christs holy Gospel-spirit, and all the words, truths and things thereof) <hi>will follow after men, into judgement.</hi> And when detected by the al-searching light and <hi>brightness of Christs second coming,</hi> or spirit, in which he will come, both they and their works will be destroyed, by the scorching heat thereof. To their great amazement and surprize, will these hidden sinners in mans day, have the worst on't, in Gods. The former will have enough on't. Both will receive the just <hi>recompence of their</hi> several <hi>errours.</hi> A final sentence of condemnation and unextinguishable wrath will be upon both. Many of both sorts, passe currant, all along this world, in their severall or joynt outward and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward riches, flourish and prosperity, pleasing themselves in their various pathes, to the same <hi>Chambers</hi> of eternal <hi>death.</hi> In this world, God deals with friends as
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:206287:50"/> foes, and foes as friends. True aints, under the Cross, within and without, plagued and chastned every morning; while litteral and mystical sinners, are oft gratified with more than heart can wish, in litteral, or in <hi>Laodicean</hi> wealth, the mystical riches of a fruitful first-covenant righteous life, by them chosen, above and against the second; <hi>Psal.</hi> 73. Foes, receive their fading good things in this life, with <hi>Dives;</hi> Friends, their durable, heavenly good things, in the next, with <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and the first fruits thereof, while in this. Saints, after all their sufferings under the dispensation of the Cross, (in managing of which, Christ uses <hi>wicked</hi> men and Angels, <hi>as his Sword,</hi> to run down all worldly life, in them) will find their tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, on all hands, so over-recompenced in the unchangable good things of the next, that they'l reckon all their sufferings to have been but a short, troublesome dream. When they awake out of the death and loss of all their fading good things in the life or <hi>image of the earthly,</hi> they'l be satisfied with the durable riches they'l find in the life and <hi>Image of the heavenly Adam;</hi> Psal. 17. 15.</p>
                  <p>And the mystical as well as litttral <hi>Dives,</hi> or rich man, will, at last, find all his fading treasure and prosperity in this world, a Dream.

<pb n="97" facs="tcp:206287:50"/> Cross, nor bearing such deep dilcernable markes of their conformity with Christ in his death, as the other; the life, activity and fruits of their spiritual man, run pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably very low, and are so small and obscure, as to be reckoned hid. But cannot be altogether hid, to themselves, here; and <hi>shall be manifested to all, before the judgment seat of Christ,</hi> hereafter. Let us more particularly consider both these matters; and first, the good <hi>workes that are manifest before-hand.</hi> These are of two sorts, death-works and life-works, both demonstrating the truth and power of their spiritual faith, as amounting to a fellowship with Christ, in his death and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection. <hi>Abrahams</hi> faith was an active co-worker with Christ, in a resolute car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying on the sacrificing-work of the Cross, on his mystical <hi>Isaac,</hi> or natural spirit, in the first-covenant life thereof, signified by his obedient resolution to offer up the litteral, at Gods command. And this mortifying work on his earthly members and state of life, justified or manifested him to be a true spiritual saint. He looked on himself, but as <hi>a Pilgrim and stranger, in the</hi> mystical first creation <hi>Land of promise,</hi> or state of life. <hi>He sought a better, that is, an heavenly; Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 16. He, with <hi>Isaac, Jacob</hi> and other saints, looked on themselves but as <hi>Sojourners</hi> in that both litteral and mystical <hi>Canaan,</hi> dwelling in moveable Tents and Tabernacles; vers. 9, 10. <hi>They confessed themselvs strangers there,</hi> to God and their true home or everlasting habitation, in the spirit of Christ. The works, by which <hi>James</hi> asserts, <hi>Abraham</hi> was justified <hi>(Jam:</hi> 2. 21, 24) were so far from being those deeds of the Law, <hi>Paul</hi> excludes from any share in his justification, <hi>(Rom:</hi> 4. 1, 5) that they were death-blows on the very first-covenant life and principle of all Law-works. His works tended to the disabling him to perform one tittle of the Law, in the spirit of the Law, that he might perform every tittle of it, in the spirit of the Gospel. This spirit is called <hi>Love,</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.) and said to be <hi>the fulfiller of the whole Law,</hi> in the comprehensive meaning and voice thereof, litteral and spiritual; <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 8, 10. The Law of God, in its full meaning, requires more from man, then, in his very innocency he was ever able to perform, in the active power of his natural principles and life. The passive obedience of man, therein, even to the death and utter abolition thereof, is the highest strein of obedience he can express, by the right use of that life of the Law, and of highest advantage to himself. Had God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired more of man then he could perform in his first created condition, and not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Gospel-spirit and life of everlasting righteousness, to be partaken of, by him (on obedient surrender of the former) in which, he may perform all, he had been <hi>a hard Master,</hi> indeed. <hi>The Gospel-spirit</hi> of faith, by crucifying and disabling the Law-spirit of nature, in man, <hi>does not make void, but enables man to fullfil the Law; Rom.:</hi> 3. 28, 31. <hi>Paul</hi> throwes off all trouble of dispute with the misjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wisdom of man, in first-covenant principles, as an apostate from his former eminency in the righteous life of the Law. He appeals to the very death-marks up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, there, for his justification against all their false surmizes. <hi>Henceforth let no man trouble me; For I bear in my body the markes of the Lord Jesus (Gal.</hi> 6. 17.) <hi>That the life also of Jesus might be manifested in my mortall flesh</hi> (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10, 11.) or mortal, fleshly, first-covenant life of my natural spirit, in which I formerly was
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:206287:51"/> eminent. Once, who but <hi>Paul,</hi> in holy flesh, life of the Law? <hi>If any man had whereof to glory, there, he more; Phil.</hi> 3. 4. But after Gospel conversion, <hi>a fool, a no-body,</hi> there, to those first-covenant saints, that were rich, full and confident, in the life he had quitted, as <hi>dung and losse;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 10. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 12. So <hi>Job,</hi> when run down in his first covenant life, by the Cross, his three mistaking friends, (far inferiour to what he had been, in the glory, wisdom, and fruitful exercise of that life) censure him either as a hypocrite, that did but craftily dissemble, in all his pretensions to that sort of righteousness; or if he had been reall and hearty in that principle, then they judg him an apostate. Spiritual saints should not, at all, <hi>passe for mans day,</hi> or regard the strange censures and false opinions, first-covenant saints will make and have of the second. Secondly then, come we to consider those good works that are not so manifest before-hand, in such as yet, at bottome, are spiritual Saints. They may have something of Christs spiritual life, stirring in them though their active and busy natural spirit, in its own way, will and course, hinder the activity of their spiritual principle, from such discernable peculiar fruits thereof, as it has in the former. <hi>The hidden works of darkness</hi> and enmity to Gods spirit, under all <hi>fair shews in</hi> holy <hi>flesh,</hi> shall be manifested at last, in the incorrigible enemies of God and his Gospel-spirit. And then shall the good works of spiritual saints (un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what ever contrary appearances, and disguises, through the activity of their natural man, or through the marred visage and spoiled state thereof, as to holy flesh, be brought to light, in open view. Then only will it be evident who are unchangably righteous, and who incorrigibly wicked <hi>(Mal.</hi> 3. 17, 18.) in the sight of all Angels and men, good and bad: And accordingly shall they receive their just respective recompences. Then will that truth be compleatly made good, <hi>Esay.</hi> 3. 10, 11. <hi>It shall be everlastingly well with the</hi> unchangibly <hi>righteous, and ill with the</hi> incorrigibly <hi>wicked, in the eternal life of the one, and death of the other.</hi>

                  <p>SErvants that profess the New name and Gospel-Doctrine of Christ, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the yoke of a Masters will, are to performe their lawful service to him, with all care and diligence, as a duty, Christ requires, in obedience to him. They are to perform such duty, not with <hi>Eye-service, as men-pleasers, but in singlenes of heart, as to Christ,</hi> who will reward them. And, without respect of persons, he will punish a saint, that performes not faithful service to an evil, or heathen master; <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 22, 25. All this, <hi>that his name and doctrine be not blasphemed,</hi> or ill spoken of. He will have his Gospel-spirit in them, evidenced to be the best performer of all duty to God and man; That, which will make the best subject and servant to a heathen Prince or Master. It keeps the eye and heart, singly fixed on God, as under his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant observation, in all they do to man. So they'l equally perform faithful service to their masters, when absent, as if present; not in a mercenary, but free, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained manner, as <hi>Christs freemen</hi> in the Gospel-principle of true liberty, though mans servants. And their Masters, if spiritual saints, though free, as to men, are <hi>Christ servants,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 22. No saints are to be <hi>servants of men,</hi> so as to be ruled by the wisdom and will of men, in things pertaining to God; vers. 23. So much, of the litteral sense. In the mystical, Christ is the master, who has been, in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the exemplary and principal servant, under the yoke, shewing all other ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants the right performance of their duty, in obedience to his will, by what he has done, in obedience to his fathers, under the Cross, to the death. <hi>The same mind ought to be in us, as in him, so to suffer the death</hi> of our nature, in the changable righteous life of the Law, as to be brought forth in the everlasting righteous life of his Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-spirit, that can never Sin. So shall we come, at last, to <hi>cease from sin,</hi> for ever. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. When that, that can sin, is wholly gone, and we filled with, and possessed of a spirit that can never sin, for the only ruling principle of our life, desire, thought, and action, we are rid of sin, for ever. When Christ has restored in men, the changable righteous life of their own nature, lost in the first <hi>Adam</hi> (as a first benefit of the right death and losse of it, in the second) he thereby capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citates them for a new triall, in their own persons, whether by the same evil use, the first man made of it, they'l refuse his more excellent life, and so lose all; or, by the same good use, the second made of it, by death and sacrifice, save and gain all. We must hate and part with the fading life of our own nature, at best, in conformity to his death therein, for that more excellent life, into which he has exalted our

Now, if in love to their own life, they refuse his, they themselves do blasphem his new name and all his Gospel-doctrine, and give occasion to others to blaspheme both. But, if they hate, and willingly deliver up themselves, at best, in all the life and motion of their own nature and will, for him, they do evidence, that they account their great spiritual Lord and Master, worthy of all honour. The only way to honour him, in the right, obedient use of all their fading first-creation substance, life, and riches <hi>(Prov.</hi> 3. 9.) is the free parting with all, for his Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly, and durable new-creation life and treasure, which the young man refused to do, when counselled by Christ himself; <hi>Mat.</hi> 19. 21, 22.

In the Gospel-spirit, both master and servant will perform the mutual duties of their places, as servants to the great master of both, Christ himself. The servant, though superiour in the Gospel-life and knowledg of Christ, ought so much the more exactly to perform the duty of his inferiour natural relation to his master. But what if a beleeving servant have not only an unbeleeving, but unjust, trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>som, unreasonable master, that will not be pleased, do he never so well? In this case <hi>is he to endure grief, suffering wrongfully, and take all patiently. This is thank worthy, and acceptable with God.</hi> This is to be looked on as part of the Cross of Christ, upon him, <hi>who did no sin, yet suffered as an evil doer,</hi> to the utmost extreamity, and <hi>threatned not</hi> but took all silently and patiently, <hi>committing himself to him that judgeth righteously,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 23. Devils and men, in all their unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ablenesses towards saints, are used and over-ruled by Christ, to carry on the work of his Cross, on their own will, for their good. Christ himself is such a seemingly hard master, that when his first-covenant servants are never so exact and faithful in their obedience to him, according to their present light and principle (as <hi>Job</hi> was testified by God himselfe, to be) yet he has something to say against them, and will be upon them with strips, even to death it self. This did put <hi>Job,</hi> for a while into a great maze and confusion, so that he uttered some unadvised words, which he repented of, when wakned up into a spiritual discerning, that unriddled all. <hi>Let the servants of God</hi> do never so well in their first covenant principle, they must suffer what they reckon the utmost hardship and evill, therein, even to the death and losse of that very life, and all the riches and fruits, brought forth and heaped up, therein, as Gods most wise method and way, for their receiving a heavenly life and treasure, in the room thereof.

All that fixedly set up themselves in the first-covenant life, against their Lord and Master in the second, will be dealt with, in conclusion, as his incorrigible ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.

Mans and Satans other Gospel is for mens establishing and exalting themselvs in the unbroken spirit, wisdom, restored life, righteousness and fading Glory of their own nature, as a state of everlasting salvation. <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy withdraw from such.</hi> For, their minds, being corrupted from, and destitute of all Gospel truth, they suppose that <hi>gain is godliness.</hi> Whatever deckes, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorns their own nature, as the fading wisdom, glory and righteousnes thereof, does, they are willing to take for true godliness, and therefore never to be parted with.

Thus were the <hi>Galatians bewitched,</hi> with the fading life, glory and riches of their own nature, in holy <hi>flesh,</hi> so as to turn their backes on Christs Gospel-life, and holy spirit, with all the things and truths thereof. Thus go thousands, under mans and satans charmings, pleasantly, to Hell, finding no hard sayings, no Cross, no Gospel-sword or fire, in their self-pleasing way, that speaks war and death to nature, at its best. But at length, the self-same Cross, Gospel-sword or spirit, comes upon them, in unchangable wrath. This get men, by engaging in strifes of words, to maintain <hi>the form of godlines</hi> in their own nature, against <hi>the power of</hi> it, in Christs Gospel-spirit. They contend for letter, figure, and shadow, holy flesh, against, grace, substance, and truth, in Christs holy spirit. Hence proceed their envy, and railings at all Christs Gospel-truths. These, <hi>Timothy</hi> and all true saints are to withdraw and seperate from, as the most abominable and offensive to

The thoughts and words of Gods wisdom, herein, are in a perfect contrariety to mans. They think, they <hi>need nothing,</hi> conducible to their true blessedness, God saies, they need every thing, have nothing towards it, as Christ told the young man, that hoped he should have heard from him, that he <hi>lacked no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for eternal life. They fall into the same snare, the Devil</hi> fell into at first, by the same evil lust, springing up in him, after the first-covenant life and glory of his own nature, in preference and opposition to the second. <hi>He followed this lust,</hi> and with a full purpose of heart, resolved to fullfil it; so did <hi>finish</hi> and compleat that unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable <hi>sin,</hi> against the new-creature, Gospel spirit of Christ, which became eternal death to him, with his followers. And, man, in bringing the like unchangable mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sery and mischief upon his own head, is both principal and accessory, through his own willful choice, in the like known rebellion against God's spiritual Law, Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man nor angel can ever say, <hi>they were tempted by God,</hi> to this; <hi>Jam.</hi> 1. 13, 15. Christ has, both by his example and command, directed both, to a clean con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary choice and course. God has back'd his prohibition of their evil choice, with the menaces of eternal death; encouraged the contrary choice, with the sure and firm promises of eternal-life. This, to the utmost, clears God, from the least of tempting influence upon them, to such evil. Nor can Man or Angel, pretend any cause or necessity, in their first-created natural beings, or changable life thereof, for the making such an evil and rebellious choice, or conducing towards any incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation that way.</p>
                  <p>So must they both sit down for ever, and own their <hi>destruction,</hi> to be singly and meerly <hi>of themselves. For, in the day they were created, no such iniquity was found in them; Ezek.</hi> 28. 15. They came pure and clean, out of Gods creating hand. They were both fitted to answer his mind, as created in the perfect purity and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness of their own changable life and nature, and in a changable subjection and obedience to his new-creature-spirit and everlasting life thereof. But they both seek out and follow <hi>their own Inventions,</hi> to their own eternal ruine. For, by this meanes, a spirit of unchangable enmity to God, becomes the root and spring of all their life, desire, thought, and action. When the same evil lust springs up in men, as, at first, in evil angels, after the same fading first-creation-glory and riches, Satan is ready for them, there, to gratify them, beyond all that their hearts can wish. So does he nourish them up in those foolish and hurtful lusts, that will render them hurtfull to others round about them, friends and foes; by enticing the former, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the same snare and perdition with themselves, and most injuriously persecuting the latter, the true spiritual saint, for his contrary mind, doctrine, and way. A
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:206287:56"/> bare natural inclination to self preserving, is not sin. The natural will in Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, cast out such a word; <hi>If it be possible, let this Cup pass.</hi> But he presently drew it back, with a <hi>not my will, but thine.</hi> But, devil and man, <hi>follow</hi> the enticement of <hi>this desire,</hi> so that their <hi>lust conceives and brings forth sin; that sin; which, when fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished, is</hi> unchangable enmity to God, which brings forth eternal <hi>death</hi> to them, as the just <hi>wages and recompence</hi> thereof.

The love of any of satans peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing, worldly vanities, from the lowest to the highest, is of very perillous conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to spiritual saints. Christ made <hi>satan go behind him,</hi> with all his first-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion glories, which are delightfull to the sons of men, at best. Christ crucified that life in himself, <hi>as son of man on earth,</hi> that afforded satan a kind of hopefullness of prevailing with him, to accept of <hi>the delights of the sons of men.</hi> And he translated our nature out of that death, into the life of <hi>the Son of Man in Heaven,</hi> which is <hi>the living Word and Son of God.</hi> The death of nature at best, in us, is our full security
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:206287:58"/> from the most splendid, glittering nothings, in Satans whole worldly dominion. When all worldly desire is extinguished, in us, <hi>The prince of this world will find no part in us,</hi> as not <hi>in Christ</hi> himself. The full vigour and strength of worldly desire and thought in us, is our weakness, by which, we are easily and willingly caught in Satans snares. The weakness thereof, is part of our strength, against them: The full death thereof, our absolute and final deliverance from them all. And, by the second operation of the spirit of the cross, quickning us up into its own life, have we positive salvation, or actual possession of an everlasting righteous life. <hi>The good souldier of Christ, must throw off the armour of man,</hi> as fast as he can; quit all the very righteous life, wisdom, and strength of his own nature, with all expedition, lest engaged, unawares, therein, on the enemies side. And then is he, as fast, <hi>to put on the armour,</hi> and grow up in the strength, of his spiritual Lord, <hi>and in the power of his might,</hi> to fight his battels against all visible and invisible principalities and powers of this world. In the mysterious way of death, did Christ himself ascend his triumphal chariot over the heads of all enemies. All his true soldiers, must con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer, the same way. Their own life, must be fought against, and run down by them in the power of the spirit of Christ, as the most dangerous enemy. This done, all other enemies lie as dead, at their feet. <hi>Paul,</hi> when he had <hi>received the sentence of death</hi> from Christ, on his righteous first-covenant life, he sided with Christ, as his faithfull souldier, in a speedy carrying on the execution thereof, for the hastening his compleat <hi>conformity with Christ, in his death.</hi> The quitting our own fading life, at best with all the things or affaires thereof, is the only way to be disentangled from all affairs of it, and <hi>lay hold on eternal life,</hi> in which we are sure and certain conquerours. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Christ spoiled and triumphed over</hi> the evil angelical <hi>prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities,</hi> by destroying that changable life of nature, in himself, their dominion consists in. The spiritual sword will beat down all enemies <hi>Carnal weapons,</hi> upon their own heads. Saints have encouragement enough, the all powerful weapon and strength of Christs Gospel-spirit, certainty of victory; yea, of being more then conquerours; and, for recompence, <hi>a Crown of glory,</hi> and eternall life. Their own flesh, or fleshly mind, in the highest light and righteousness thereof, is their most dangerous (though not most potent) enemy, because a traiterous conspiratour with world and devil. But, that new-creature spirit of Christ, that manages the battel in them, is backed with the allmighty and infinite divinity, in his person. If the everlasting armes of <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son</hi> can secure them, all is safe. All thats divine and heavenly is engaged in this war, against <hi>flesh, world and devil; Jo.</hi> 10. 28, 29. God has promised, by an oath, to settle them in the true land of promise and rest, a state of eternal life, and has <hi>sworn in his wrath,</hi> his, and their incorrigible enemies <hi>shall never enter into that rest, Heb.</hi> 6. 13, 18. <hi>and,</hi> 3. 7, 11. Hence will foes be filled with all imaginable evil, and saints with unspeakable good, and comfort, for ever. <hi>Timothy,</hi> and so, other Saints, being called up, into the awaken'd exercise of spiritual life, are therein, called to make their <hi>Good confession of Christ, in his new</hi> creation <hi>name</hi> and life, and <hi>a profession</hi> of their resolved faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful obedience to him, therein, <hi>before many witnesses.</hi> Who are these?

                  <p>To shew the great weight of this charg to <hi>Timothy, Paul</hi> declares he delivers it to him, in the sight of <hi>God, who quickens all things, and that,</hi> as the very <hi>same thing, Chirst himself witnessed before Pontius Pilate.</hi> This confession, witnessed by Christ, was the sum and substance of all truth. The account hereof, we find, <hi>John</hi> 18. 33, 40. He owns himself <hi>a King,</hi> to <hi>Pilate;</hi> but, that <hi>his kingdom is not of this world: For this cause, sayes he, came I into this world, that</hi> I <hi>should bear witness to the truth. What truth?</hi> That by the death of that worldly State of our nature, at best, in the pure and spotless righteousnes of the law, he might advance it into that new-creation life of the world to come, wherein he was to become a king. He asserts, that <hi>his kingdom is not of this world,</hi> or to be managed in the worldly State of a changable first-covenant-life. Those that will be <hi>reigning as kings</hi> there (as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8.) are in a presumptuous contrariety to his kingdom, and the spirit, wherein he will reign: and, on the other hand, the disturbers of corrupt worldly <hi>Cesars.</hi> The true spiritual fifth-monarchy mans principles render him the quietest and best subject, any worldly <hi>Cesar</hi> can have in his dominions. <hi>Pilate</hi> perceiv'd, that though Christ asserted himself to have a kingdom, yet his kingdom was of such a nature, as gave no disturbance to his Master, <hi>Cesar.</hi> And therefore, after all, <hi>He told the Jews,</hi> that <hi>he found no fault in him,</hi> at all. The <hi>Jews,</hi> that charged him as an enemy to <hi>Cesar,</hi> were themselves the enemies both of Christ and <hi>Cesar.</hi> They would have made him such a temporal king, in that first-covenant-life and state of our nature, he had taken, as would have rendred both him and them, enemies to <hi>Cesar.</hi> But, he refused. <hi>When he perceived they would take him by force, to make him a king,</hi> he conveighed himself out of their hands, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6. 15. It was their madness against him, for not owning himself a king, but indeed <hi>crucifying their king,</hi> even himself, in that worldly state (wherein they could own him as a king) which would have clashed with <hi>Cesar:</hi> It was this, made them accuse him, as the enemy of <hi>Cesar,</hi> under the general notion of a king, in a tumultuous noise and outcry. <hi>Whoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever makes himself a king, speakes against Cesar,</hi> say they. On this, though <hi>Pilate,</hi> before, was convinced, that such a king as Christ own'd himself to be, was no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:206287:59"/> against <hi>Cesar, He delivered him to them, to be crucified. And he writ on his Cross, his Accusation</hi> by the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the only cause of his death, <hi>Jesus of Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, king of the Jews.</hi> All this, we find, <hi>John</hi> 19. 1, 19. Their pretended imputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of blasphemy to him, as <hi>making himself the son of God,</hi> would not do their work. <hi>Pilate sought to release him,</hi> notwithstanding that. So their last and utmost shift, they had recourse to, was to charge him with treason against <hi>Cesar.</hi> And so, without any proff, but a meer tumultuous out-cry, they carry it. Thus do first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant professours make the heathen magistrate the executer of their enmity, against the second. The true cause, at bottom, of the <hi>Jewes</hi> murdering mind of enmity against Christ, was his Gospel-doctrin of the new-covenant, that spake death to all they rested on, in the first, for salvation. The cause, above-board, was pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed treason against <hi>Cesar.</hi> So betwixt <hi>heathen</hi> and first-covenant<hi>-People,</hi> was he hurried out of the world, as one signal accomplishment of <hi>(Psal.</hi> 2. 1, 2.) quoted and interpreted, <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 25, 28. <hi>Of a truth, against thy holy Child Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the People of Israel were gathered together.</hi> But, in the midst of all that confusion and tumult, Christ gave a short, but clear and full Gospel-testimony, before <hi>Pilate,</hi> which is also to be given and owned by all true saints, as containing the summe of all truth. It shews, wherein Christs kingdom does not consist, and wherein it does. So does it comprehend the negative and affirmative part of all Gospel-truth. The negative is, that Christs kingdom does not consist in any thing that is worldly, or of the first creation. When himself had taken our wordly nature, in the spotles purity and perfection of it, he refused, in that, to be a King, Judg, or Ruler, or so much as to be <hi>called good,</hi> because but changably, not absolutly so. <hi>To this end was I born,</hi> said he, <hi>and for this cause came I into the world</hi> (or took this changable fleshly life and nature of man) <hi>That I should bear witness unto the truth.</hi> What truth? That he had a spiritual life and kingdom, belonging to him, and as a seal to this truth, was ready to give up the changable first-covenant life and state of our nature, which was but naturall and worldly. <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world,</hi> or, in this worldly life; but, in a life, perfectly distinct from this, spiritual and heavenly, in a spirit that is everlasting righteousness and truth. <hi>What is truth?</hi> said <hi>Pilate.</hi> This question was answered before-hand. The Gospel-spirit, in which Christ was <hi>a King. That</hi> is <hi>truth,</hi> infallible truth; which no other creature-spirit or life is. This <hi>good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession of Christ, before Pilate,</hi> are all his true followers to make, as soon as the light of his kingdom-spirit, is, by him, set up in them, which discovers and reveales him, in his spiritual life, to them. Their owning his kingdom, and their share therein, to be only in that more excellent, new-covenant-life, and not at all, in that, wherein <hi>Paul</hi> found the first-covenant <hi>Corinthians reigning as Kings, that he could not reign with;</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8.) This testimony will be of the same provoking nature, to a first-covenant people, (in all Ages) in holy flesh, the restored life and righteousness of man, as Christs Gospel-testimony was to the professing <hi>Jews.</hi> And, in witnessing this truth, the servants, as well as the lord, if called to it, must be in a readines, to deliver up their bodily life. <hi>Paul</hi> charges <hi>Timothy,</hi> and in him,
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:206287:60"/> all true saints, to give the same testimony, or make the same confession of their Gospel-faith, Christ himself made before <hi>Pilate,</hi> as to the spirit in which his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom does consist, or any can be saved, let <hi>heathen rage or a</hi> first-covenant <hi>People imagine,</hi> while, and what they will against them. The true saints fifth-monarchy prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, gives no disturbance to worldly Governors, it looks quit another way, towards a <hi>kingdom thats not of this world,</hi> or ever to be expected, <hi>till Christ</hi> himself <hi>appear</hi> in the Glory of his new-creation life, <hi>and all his saints with him.</hi> The spirit they are of, teaches such passive obedience and silent submission to what the Lord will suffer worldly <hi>Cesars</hi> to do with or to them, as renders them their most peaceable subjects and that, <hi>in conscience towards God,</hi> and obedience to his will, <hi>taking all patiently, suffer they never so wrongfully; Rom:</hi> 13. 5. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 19, 23.

<pb n="117" facs="tcp:206287:60"/> death, surrender and losse of that life, in which his kingdom does not consist, for that, in which it does. It consists not, in the most righteous first-covenant life of the law, in mans natural spirit and make, with all the meats, drinkes and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of that: But, in the everlasting, new-creature Gospel-life and righteousness of God, which gives everlasting <hi>peace with him, and joy in the holy Ghost, Rom.</hi> 14. 17. Saints must give like proof of their obedience and love to Christ, in keeping his charg and command, herein, as he, to his father, for their sakes. <hi>If ye love me, keep my command and charg, as I have loved my father and you, in keeping his. So shall ye abide in my love, as I in my fathers. And ye shall be my friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soever I command you, Jo.</hi> 15. 9, 10. 14. Christ gave up his changable righteous first-covenant life of the Law, in our nature, for the everlasting righteous new-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant life of the Gospel, without the least blemish or failing, in the dark and dismal death-passe of our nature, thereinto. When saints do submit to the full work of his cross, on nature, at best, or, in whatever condition, in them, not defiling them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves by any unlawfull lust after, or love to any thing that natural and worldly, in or round about them, then do they <hi>keep his charg, unrebukably,</hi> as he his father's. They must <hi>not love their own life, but</hi> indeed <hi>hate it, unto death (Rev.</hi> 12. 11.) <hi>or cannot be his disciples</hi> and followers into that everlasting righteous life, in which his kingdom does consist; <hi>Luke.</hi> 14. 26, 27. Mans cost, relating to the building up the house of his nature into a newness of life, is quietly to bear the demolishing of the old. If he bid never so fair for eternal life, short of a roundly parting with all that he has, the new building will never be finished. So, after all pretensions towards it, and quitting this, and that, for it, he will be exposed to mockery, and the same <hi>everlasting contempt,</hi> with other incorrigible enemies thereof, that never pretended any thing towards it. Christ, by his ambassadours, propounds termes of peace with us, and we must return our answer, in submission to his offered conditions, for an everlasting peace with him, which is the <hi>forsaking all that we have,</hi> life and all. On these terms, he will give us his transcendently more excellent life, and the enjoyment of all that he has; vers. 28. 33. Saints, in obedience to this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, are to wait for Christs appearing to them in his more excellent life. And, this does Christ, first in particular, to each saint, in this world, when he quickens up the said life, in them, which is an appearing to, or a revealing of himself, in them, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 15, 16. Under the progressive workings, and death-blows of the Gospel-spirit or cross, on their natural man, are they to wait for and pant after Christs appearing to them, in the life of that spirit, which puts theirs to death, and not turn back, in their desire and love, to that life he is running down in them, or any of the perishing meats, things, or concerns thereof. And, both before and after Christs thus particularly appearing to them, by the actual quickning and setting up his own life in them, are they earnestly to long after, and yet patiently wait for his second personal comming &amp; general appearing to all, good and bad, in the full glory of his spiritual life, to the compleating their salvation or deliverance from all evils, dangers, enemies, bondages and deaths, litteral or mystical, and so, compleating, their joy, in eternal life. <hi>Ʋnto this salvation, to be revealed,</hi> at last, are saints kept by the

While Christ shuts up himself, in an invisibility to the world, in this spiritual life, saints must be content to have it hid with Christ, in God; and so, in their invisible, spiritual saintship, however Glorious within, in Gods sight and their own, to lie cleer out of the reach and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning of the natural man, however <hi>wise, strong, and honourable in Christ,</hi> as to visible saintship, in a first-covenant life. This right, chast and faithful <hi>waiting for Christs appearing,</hi> particular and general, <hi>Paul prays for,</hi> on behalf of the <hi>Thessalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> as the only way to be kept without spot, and blameless; 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> here explaines what appearing of the Lord he chiefly means, even his second personal appearance in the unchangable righteous life of his infallible gospel-spirit, in distinction from his first comming, in flesh, or changable righteous life and falli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light of the first-covenant spirit of nature. This, he appeared to suffer, in. The other, <hi>he will appear</hi> and reign <hi>in, with all his saints, at the set time,</hi> for their full delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and their enemies ruine, <hi>Ps.</hi> 102. 13. 'Tis in the life, he has raised our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture into, all this will be done; as <hi>Paul</hi> interprets, <hi>Ps.</hi> 2. 7. <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 33. This second comming of Christ, was the principal intendment, in his former, and of all the dispensations of God, from the beginning of the world, to the ending thereof; Yea, of the very creation of Angels and men. Both his commings were appointed of God, and signified in his written oracles. As Christ then has <hi>manifested himself in our flesh,</hi> he will, with the same infallible certainty, shew himself <hi>in his spirit, at his appointed time.</hi> And therein, will he make himself known to all, friends and foes, <hi>to be the only Potentate, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi> He will then deal as he please, with all. And, mean while, does he make all the revengful shafts, spears, and arrows, directed by devils or men, against that spirit, in himself and saints (in which he and they will reign) exactly serviceable to his designs, by his cross, for the destruction of their own party, in them, <hi>the heel,</hi> or natural man, which is undispensably necessary to the salvation of their whole man, in that spirit, he will appear, and judg the world, in. Does God deliver up <hi>Job</hi> or other saints, into the hands of devils or men? Tis but <hi>for the destruction of that flesh,</hi> themselves are bound to mortify and run down, by his spirit. But though this second comming of Christ, be a most certain truth, the Apostle, by saying, which in his time he shall shew, does shew, that this truth, till then, as certain as it is, will not only be doubted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sputed, but absolutly denied, all along this world, under Satans reign, and in mans day, or judgment; and never be so universally feoffed at, as when Christ is at the door, and ready to come forth. The appearance of this glorious potentate, will be unspeakable joy to friends, and unutterable consternation to enemies. A mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:206287:61"/> darkness, and more general disregard, then ever, of any such thing, will imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly precede it. Many in this or former ages, that from the cogent letter of many scriptures, have asserted Christs thousand years reign on earth, and thence been called millenaries, have given little aim at the Gospel-spirit or principle, in which he and his saints will reign. So, the very truth, the very Christ, the very spirit, in which he will reign, have had very few assertors. And whoever assert it, in the last, most scoffing, deriding times (2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 3.) Must expect a fiercer shock of opposition, and a more universal contradiction, then ever. Many, that can digest the asserting of his reign in general, will be as highly offended as any, when a right character is given of the Gospel-spirit, in which he will reign. To none will this doctrine be more disgustfull, then first-covenant-saints, that are only for a reign in holy flesh, righteousness of man (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8.) that <hi>neither Christ, Paul or any</hi> spiritual saint <hi>can reign with;</hi> but, over. They that hate all the right words or doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of his Gospel-life, will be sorry to see him in it; and a King, too. This is the most important matter, insisted on, all a long the scriptures; the crown of all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer dispensations, all a long this world, <hi>spoken by the mouth of all Gods holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, since the world began, (Act.</hi> 3. 21.) Yet, how many, that pretend highly to be expounders of the scripture, absolutly deny it? So, when Christ was come, had done and suffered all, the scriptures had foretold, in the flesh, and the <hi>Jews</hi> had done to him, all, the scriptures foretold they would do to him, so as to fulfill their own scriptures, in condemning him, <hi>they were</hi> yet <hi>ignorant,</hi> as to what they did; <hi>Act.</hi> 13. 26, 28. What work does the wisdom of man, in righteous first-covenant <hi>Jew</hi> or Christian, make of it, as to the spiritual sense, and mind of God, in all scripture? Is not this a marvellous thing, that so many wise, holy, learned under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers at scripture, should misse the principal intendment of all scripture? The <hi>Jewish</hi> teachers owned <hi>Moses</hi> and rejected Christ. They took not the meaning of the Holy Ghost in one tittle of <hi>Moses,</hi> or the Prophets, they interpreted. <hi>Moses,</hi> rightly understood, accuses you, sayes Christ, and owns me; <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>. At this passe, are many interpreters at this day, as to the right understanding the design of Christs first comming, as they shew, by not rightly owning his second. So, the holy Ghost truly interprets these interpreters, to be deniers of his first, what ere they say, think as hardly as they will of the censure; <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 2, 3. If all that <hi>acknowledg Christ come in the flesh</hi> (as a matter of fact, without a due considering and owning the design thereof) <hi>were of God,</hi> what a world of spiritual saints, should we have? If not, what a world of antichristians? <hi>The Prince of this world,</hi> in first-covenant righteousness, such as <hi>Paul</hi> found at <hi>Corinth</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 8.) crucified Christ, in enmity to his Gospel-spirit of true Kingship, that would have owned him for King, in that first-covenant spirit, they were of, which neither he, nor <hi>Paul,</hi> nor any true saint can own them in, so as to joyn, and <hi>reign with them.</hi> All wise first-covenant Kings, <hi>till</hi> they become <hi>fools there, with Paul, that they may be wise with him,</hi> in the Gospel-spirit of the second, do most prodigiously stumble at, and misse the true reach and principal intendment of all scripture, both as to Christs first and second comming; not owning the true intent of his first, in reference to his second. His
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:206287:62"/> first comming, in flesh, and his demeanour therein, was in order to give eternal salvation to men, in the spirit of his second. So, deny this, and deny all. Both the negative and affirmative part of Christs full Gospel-testimony before <hi>Pilate,</hi> and so his whole Gospel is denied, and rejected, by self-confident first-covenant Kings. They hold the reign of Christ to be in that worldly spirit, and so his kingdom to be of this world. And consequently, do they utterly deny that Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness, in which alone it does consist, the spirit of the world to come. Thus by the carnal, first-covenant-gospeller, every word of Christs Gospel is thrown out of their Church doors. The spirit of all, is exploded as an aery notion, and the letter only kept within doors, and made much on, as pleasing their own and satan's pallate, with the things of man, only. Nothing of the things of God, will down with them. What sad work must Christ's coming forth in the true fifth-monarchy-spirit, needs make with all this tribe of professors, that are found in direct enmity to him and all his words? And never will professors be found more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally doting, in this case, then when Christ is ready to break forth upon them, and spoil all their work.</p>
                  <p>There is already, considerable acknowledged experience of a blast, and that a false, short-sighted interpreting of scripture, however kept up, does not profit the people, at all. <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 32. First-covenant life and doctrine, for salvation, is blasted and withered; ere long, it will be laid more open and naked yet, as an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated ceremony. The clearer and brighter, Gospel-testimony grows, against this overspreading heresy, the more will it <hi>torment all that dwell upon the earth,</hi> or in the image of the earthly. On this ground, will both they and the devil be highly offended at, and have great wrath against this harbinger, or preparatory messenger to the image of the heavenly. This report of Christs near approach therein, will sorely disturb the peace of Satans and mans worldly dominion. But Christs actual comming forth therein, as new-creation King, will spoil all. Such spiritual Saints, as in harmony with holy Angels, shall be engaged in giving this preparatory witness (by way of alarm to the sleepy world) to Christs second comming, <hi>shall,</hi> after their wonder-working power, accompanying their testimony, <hi>be slain.</hi> And joyful will the <hi>inhabitants of Earth and Sea,</hi> first-covenant Saints, and profane common sinners, be. But, after a short time, their dead bodies and dry bones get up again, and they <hi>stand upon their feet,</hi> with all their fellow witnesses, in all times and ages, <hi>an exceeding great</hi> and puissant <hi>Army.</hi> This will spoil all their enemies mirth. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 11. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 37. 10. But Christs own personal comming forth, on the seventh angels sounding <hi>(Rev.</hi> 11.) Will yet more confound all incorrigible enemies. But amongst these, the first-covenant professor, in the righteousnes of man, and form of Godliness, but enmity to the power, will be hardest put to it. The corrupt, heathen party, oppressing them to that degree, as to bereave them of all hopes of visible relief, will force them to place their hopes of relief, in Christ's comming. And that very comming of his, will be more dreadfull to them, then common sinners, as the keenest enemies of the Gospel-spirit, in which he comes. To such is it said, <hi>Wo unto you that desire the day of the Lord, it will be darkness and not light, to you:</hi>
                     <pb n="121" facs="tcp:206287:62"/> The most gloomy and sad day that ever befell you; <hi>Amos</hi> 5. 18, 20. When all professors, in first and second covenant, are so hard put to it, by Heathen powers, swaggering over both their heads, in worldly dominion, so that theres no visible relief left, for either, then must they turn all their hopes for deliverance, by Christs second comming, to redress all grievances, and set all to rights. The spiritual par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of professors will have the full accomplishment of their hopes: the other, ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing disappointment, as to any good, thereby: and not only so, but seven times and seventy times seven fold more dreadfull to them will the effects of Christs so appearing be, then all brutish and unreasonable oppressions, they groaned under, from their heathen adversaries. So, they have no shift left, at all; no possible de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, on any account; but worse and worse, still, till they come to the utmost extreamity of misery, and find themselvs, therein, remediless, for ever. This, meanes the prophet, in saying to such misunderstanding <hi>desirers of the day of the Lord; It is, as if a man did flee from a Lion, and a Bear met him. Amos</hi> 5. To this desperate passe, will multitudes of professors be brought. When all warnings from God are neglected, by a fleshly, first-covenant <hi>Israel,</hi> what lesse can be expected, but that the <hi>wrath of God should arise against his people, till there be no remedy,</hi> or healing, <hi>left?</hi> 2 <hi>Chron:</hi> 36. 15, 16. None but <hi>dwellers in Heaven (Rev:</hi> 12. 12.) such <hi>as have had their conversation in Heaven (Phil.</hi> 3. 20.) <hi>affections set on things above (Col.</hi> 3. 2.) will have a joyful time of it, at Christs second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. As rightly looking then for the great and glorious things, that will be done, at that day, the melting down all earthly first-creation vanities, and setting up <hi>new Heavens and a new Earth (or double-portioned,</hi> Heavenly, and single-por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Earthly new-creation saints, and in both, a dwelling or everlasting righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness) let them <hi>be diligent in all holy conversation and Godliness, that they may be found of him, without spot and blameless;</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 11, 14. They are to <hi>hasten to this day of the Lord,</hi> by circumspect walking and growing more and more up in that spiritual life, wherein he will come. Then will <hi>this blessed and only potentate,</hi> this King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, execute judgment and justice, in the earth, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23. 5. And his true <hi>saints shall reign with him, on the earth;</hi> not in an earthly, first-covenant life, but spiritual, resurrection state, in which the kingdom is given him by his father, and <hi>utmost parts of the earth put into his possession; Psa.</hi> 2. 7, 8. <hi>This King of Kings,</hi> or of those highest, priestly, spiritual and most heavenly saints, that shall reign with and under him, on the earth <hi>(Rev.</hi> 5. 10.) was, by way of vision, shewed <hi>John,</hi> as <hi>having on his Vesture and Thigh, a Name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; Rev.</hi> 19. 16. <hi>and</hi> 17. 14 In this state, will Christ execute the whole divine mind and will of God, in reference to friends and foes, as made <hi>the only Potentate and King of Kings;</hi> even the man Christ, as pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessed, not only, of that everlasting righteous creature-life, in which his name al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so is, <hi>the word of God (Rev:</hi> 19. 13.)

By partaking of, and dwelling in Christs new-creature, Gospel-spirit, that in him dwells in and with the infinite divinity, do saints see God through that spirit, in him; never, otherwise. 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 12, 13. <hi>No man can see God,</hi> in his immediate divine brightness, <hi>and live,</hi> as he told <hi>Moses.

He tells <hi>Moses, he had found a meanes, to make all his divine goodness passe before him,</hi> even <hi>that rocky</hi> place, or everlasting righteous creature-state, by him, in personal union with him, which he calls his <hi>back-parts,</hi> but <hi>his divine face, can never be seen</hi> by him, without this Vail upon it. Through this, only, can men be <hi>seers of God,</hi> and he of them, with mutual delight, and satisfaction, for ever. First-covenant-Life, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and understanding, <hi>is the vail on mans heart,</hi> the very <hi>partition wall,</hi> between him and God. <hi>This must be rent,</hi> taken down, and abolished, that we may, by partaking of that new-creature-spirit, that's the bright vail upon God, see and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy him, for ever. Man, in the highest wisdom and light of a first-covenant life▪
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:206287:64"/> can never see the divine glory, nor the vail it self, through which it shines forth. Man, in all the light and wisdom of his own nature at best, is in downright <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkness, under an absolute impossibility of ever seeing God, there, or his spiritual heavenly, eternal, Gospel-things and truths. He is stark blind, as to the mystical, spiritual sense, reach, and significancy of all scripture. If he might live <hi>Methusalems</hi> years, in the continual exercise of that understanding, he would still be at the same passe. He would as universally misse the spiritual sense of all scripture, as if he had never read them. Eyes, or an understanding he has, such as it is, but sees nothing thats of a spiritual nature. Wise or fool, as to first-covenant light and wisdom; learned or unlearned, both are alike, at all spiritual things, or truths; <hi>Es.</hi> 29. 11, 12. <hi>The mysteries of the kingdom of God, the unsearchable riches of Christ person,</hi> the summ of <hi>Pauls</hi> Gospel-ministry <hi>(Eph.</hi> 3. 8, 9.) are wholly shut up, from both. And thus have we seen that Christ alone has that fountain creature-immortality, in personal union with the infinite divinity, and so, <hi>dwelleth in that light, no other can approach unto,</hi> so neer as he by immediate union with it, <hi>nor ever see it,</hi> as he does. These things are all peculiar to the man Christ, <hi>to whom be honour and power everlasting.</hi> Here is the doxology to this blessed <hi>and only Potentate, the man Christ Jesus,</hi> as possessed of original creature-immortality or everlasting righteous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-life, and the infinite divine life. <hi>To him belongs honour and power everlasting, as dwelling in the</hi> divine <hi>light, which no other can;</hi> and unvailing or revealing the same, to his creatures, through his immortal creature-spirit, which no other can do. Unspeakable praise and thanksgiving then is due to the man Christ, from all blessed Angels and saints, as giving the vision of the divine glory, tempered with his new-creature-glory, so as joyntly to be beheld and fed on by them, as the hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

If they do, they are sure to meet with a to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal disappointment of their expectation. The folly of mens priding themselves and trusting in the outward riches of this world, the common light of mankind, can discover and reprove. Let us then chiefly consider such mystical riches, and rich ones, as Gospel-light only can fully discover the vanity of, and ruining errour of a false confidence, in. Those that, at bottom, are spiritual saints, are apt to be high-minded and confident, in the perishing riches, life, glory, wisdom, righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness and ornament of their own nature. In this posture of spirit, did <hi>Paul</hi> find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his <hi>Corinthian, Galatian,</hi> and <hi>Philippian</hi> converts, with others; <hi>rich, full, and confident in holy flesh,</hi> which rendered them <hi>enemies to Christs holy</hi> Gospel-spirit and <hi>cross.</hi> The <hi>Corinthians,</hi> in this folly, <hi>he could not write to, as spiritual, but carnal.</hi> The <hi>Galatians</hi> had so turn'd their backs from Gospel-light, to the life of the law, the glory and riches of their own nature, in holy flesh (which they knew, were to be destroyed) that he sayes, they were <hi>bewitch'd.</hi> The <hi>Philippians</hi> were so hot and confident, at this work, that <hi>he could not write to them, without weeping, as enemies to the cross of Christ,</hi> by gratifying <hi>their own belly,</hi> or natural desire, in this fading Glory and riches of their own nature, that he has so oft <hi>warned them</hi> against. The <hi>Scribes, Pharisees,</hi> and professing Jews, were so high-minded and confident <hi>in these uncertain riches,</hi> that they crucified Christ for preaching death on all they trusted on, for eternal life. Is not here evidence enough, as to the great need, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessours stand in, of this Gospel-caution, against highmindednes and trusting in the fading riches and righteousnes of a first-covenant life, when the delusion has bin so strong and prevalent in multitudes that have thought themselves so well to pass, for Salvation, that they have withstood, blasphemed and opposed the very personal Gospel preachings of Christ and his apostles? Even <hi>Job and Paul trusted in this uncertain riches,</hi> before their regeneration, or Gospel-conversion. They were both, eminently rich in first-covenant attainments. And, though the over-value of, and confidence in these riches, was found in both, to proceed from a total igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of better; yet, at a dear rate, did they both experience the sad consequents of such a mistake. <hi>Job sin'd not with his lips,</hi> but took the loss of all his outward rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, quietly. But when he felt the blows of the Cross on his inward, mystical, first-covenant riches and life, he uttered some unadvised words, for which he was repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by <hi>Elihu,</hi> then by the Lord himself, and, at last, by himself too, in another light. He acknowledges, he <hi>had uttered things he understood not, and darkened counsel, by</hi>

                     <hi>words without knowledge.</hi> When the Lord is exercising a temporary wrath, by his Cross, on the natural man of the saint, as to all the fading life, glory and riches thereof, and does not yet appear with the <hi>sure mercies of David,</hi> to them, in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter life; they are, through mistake, at a sore loss, and in the greatest distress and trouble, imaginable. <hi>Paul,</hi> though his confidence and high-mindedness in this sort of fading riches, was meerly from ignorance, as to better (insomuch that he ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily thought he did God service when he persecuted the Gospel) it ran him, through a blind zeal for what he had, into such a high strein of persecuting enmity, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious practices towards Gospel-saints, as rendred him the chief of sinners, that stood yet capable of the Gospel-mercy, he fought against. And, <hi>David,</hi> once thought <hi>his Mountain so strong,</hi> in first-covenant-life and riches, <hi>as never to be moved.</hi> The more towring imaginations men have thereof, the more proud and confident they grow therein, the mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And from under the <hi>marr'd vissage</hi> or crucified natural man (as to visible saintship, in the form of godliness, wisdom and righteousness of man) out comes the true friend and lover of God, in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibility of his, before <hi>hidden life with Christ in God.</hi> Then, he that in this world, was reckoned a meer no body, <hi>the off-scouring of all things,</hi> the worst of sinners, by flourishing visible saints, in holy flesh, will be found the truly <hi>righteous,</hi> and they the most <hi>wicked</hi> of all incorrigible sinners. <hi>Then, shall men return</hi> from their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer mis-judging thoughts, and <hi>discern between the truly righteous and</hi> unchangably <hi>wicked; Mal.</hi> 3. 18. Is there not a cause, true spiritual Saints should refer them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, for trial, to that day? They are clear gone, <hi>in mans day;</hi> will never have his commendation. But, being sure to have the best on't, at last, they patiently bear mans mis-judgings, and wait for Gods righteous judgment. Then will the mis-judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing first-covenant-self-confident, be found the <hi>fool, blasphemer</hi> and <hi>mad-man;</hi> and <hi>all the shame</hi> and reproach, most unjustly, by him, laid on the spiritual saint, most justly cast upon himself. Then will it be found, that such good works only as are brought forth in Christs Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness, are truly pleasing to God, and everlasting <hi>profitable to men.</hi> And by communicating to others, do saints encrease their own store. For, Christ will abundantly recompence all such
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:206287:67"/> high service to him and his Saints, by these Gospel-good-works. These works are of grace, belong not at all to the Covenant of works. They are such works, as <hi>God works in man; and man, in God.</hi> Men must, with Christ, be, in some de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, at least, dead in their very spirit and principle of Law-works, before they can live unto God, and perform right-works, in his sight, in the spirit of the Gospel. 'Tis a fruitfulness only in this spirit and life, that <hi>lays up in store, a good foundation for the time to come,</hi> which will be a day of unutterable distress and need, to all others, that have nothing but perishing shadows, to shew for themselves. Nothing they can have been or done, within the compass of their own nature, will signify any thing, at that day.</p>

In this life, that, at its best, is altogether vanity, a fading flower, a shadow, man has no security for blessedness. As many as are of the works of the Law, are under the curse. <hi>For it is written, Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things, written in the law, to do them;</hi> Gal. 3. 10. The Law requires an everlasting continuance in well-do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

They never obey the spiritual and princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall voice of the Law, which directs them to quit the principles of the Law, for the spirit of the Gospel, that can fulfil all. And from their obedience to the litteral sense or voice of it, through the unsteadines of their starting principles, are they liable to roll back, with the dog to the vomit, their old sins and lusts, in the corrupt spirit of degenerate nature. So tis next to nothing, they can do, at best, in their own spirit of the law; and that, in danger, every moment, of comming to quite nothing, yea, worse then nothing. They are liable to turn all their righteousnes into
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:206287:70"/> unchangable enmity to Gods, and so to be involv'd in all mystical uncleanesses, and spiritual abominations, filth of spirit; or to return to their old trade of sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the miry filth and uncleanesses, of flesh. In both these miscarriages, they turn from their righteousnes, either by turning it into unchangable enmity to Gods, as keeping it up, in opposition to his; or by turning from it, to the unrighteousnes of man, in filth of flesh. One of these two wrong way's, will all take, in their law-spirit, and self-righteousnes, that take not the right, in exchang thereof, by death, for the Gospel-spirit, and righteousnes of God. On the account of all these defects and shortnesses of the first covenant life, as to answering the whole will of God, or meaning of his law, at all, or continuing to do it, in the lowest part of its meaning, 'tis positively declared, that by the law no man is justified, in Gods sight. Spiritual Saints are redeemed from this curse, by Christs making that spotless righteous life that cannot justify any man, a sacrifice to God, for all.

So did they carry on their work with him, and ever since, labour to fix men in that enmity they brought into their nature, at first, in which they have proved abundantly successful. Man revived by the second <hi>Adam</hi> into the life of the first, and fixing there, against the true life of the second, is in the same case with the evil Angels. Angels and mans first estate, consisted in two things, the perfection of first covenant life, in their differing natures; and, secondly, this had they both, in a changable obedience and subjection to the more excellent creature light and life of the second. Their falling from this obedience, into direct enmity to the second, was the quitting their first estate or habitation, in Christ. In this irrecoverable fall, do evil Angels retain all they had in the first, with a skill to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form themselvs also into the likeness of the second, on purpose to practice all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of spiritual wickedness, in unchangable enmity to that, and God, so as to deceive, if possible, the very Elect. Angels first sin, being unpardonable, they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the keeping what they had, in their first-creation, to practice against the second. Mans first sin, being pardonable, (as not against so cleer light as the Angels, and as seduced by a higher ranke of creatures, already fallen, and all men not extant in their own persons, at the first sin, as evil Angels were) Christ took not again, the changable state of Angelical nature, in which he had been, at first, a pattern to Angels (in becomming of the first-born of every changable creature being▪ and immediate parent, and root of all the rest, the first-begotten from the dead) but our nature only, to aton for us; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 16. <hi>and</hi> 9. 26. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 13. 8.
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:206287:71"/> The spirit of nature then, in the life of the law, is a spirit of bondage and death, in which man has cause of continual feare, and can never please God in it, at best▪ Christ did put this spirit of death, to death, in himself, and so overcame him that has the power of death, or has set up his worldly dominion in this spirit. When the unclean spirit of nature is cast out, satan can re-enter into the cleansed, righteous state of it, and by establishing man there, fixes him in unchangable enmity to God; so, becoms a seven-fold worse spirit, in his effects, upon him and in him, then the changable enmity to God, in his corrupt nature, amounted to; <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 43, 45.

In the first, satan conquers men: in the second, true saints are more then conquerours of him. This second life, communicated, makes them free, for ever, from all bondage, fear, or danger; and everlastingly justifies them, before God.

                  <p>Here is a powerful motive to the above said suffrings, and owning each other in such sufferings, for the Gospel-testimony, as their Crown and Glory, in conformity to Christ, and the will of God. He has called them, through such suffering, to salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Men have a calling from God, and salvation too, in its kind, when effectually called out of the death of nature, into the righteous life of the law. This is the common, but ther's nothing of everlasting life or special salvation, in all this. His final saving any, is not according to the works of their own spirit, in the life of the law, but of his Gospel-spirit, in them. This holy calling here then, is a call out of that very life of the law, into that of the Gospel. A ceasing from all the works, performable in that life, and the very life it self, as an antiquated ceremony, to be abolished by the cross, is undispensably needful to everlasting salvation. The life of the law, rebelliously and wilfully stayed in, after Gods call out of it, on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing discovery of a more excellent life and way, is turned into mystical <hi>Sodom,</hi> reaking, before God, in all spiritual uncleanenesses, whordomes, idolatries and and murders, under all righteousness and fair shews in the flesh. Man, by thus do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, shuts up the kingdom of heaven against himself; and satan opens his bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less pit of deceits and snares to him, by which he is certainly caught. Tis Gods pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, treasuring up for us a portion of the grace of life, in Christs Gospel-spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world began, and Christs actual giving to us that eternal life, by his holy call of us into it, that saves us. No such salvation was ever promised man, in the changable law-life of his own nature, at best, for the best works of righteousness, performable therein. In pursuance of Gods decree of love, the supream foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:206287:72"/> of saints hapiness, was the distinct portion of Gospel-life, treasured up for them, in Christs fountain creature spirit. The seed of it, was cast into their spirits, while yet but radically existing in him, before personally subsisting in their natural beings. This seed, quickened up in them, is his actual giving eternal life to them. And then, daily nourishing and strengthning them, therein, to a perfection of spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual man-hood, compleats the design, and crownes all.

To all old things, in first-creation life, renewed, do inevitably belong mystical gray hairs, decay, old age, and death. They are still of the same perishing nature, as at first. Moreover, since the fall, in their highest renewal, are they tinctured with enmity to God and his Gospel-spirit, which amounts to those dead mens bones, full of rotteness and corruption, which lie hid in such painted sepulchers, as men in all fair shews of reall holy flesh, are. The devorning spirit of the cross, on nature, at best, is the true, practical expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Sampsons</hi> typical riddle. For out of this strong, all-conquering spirit, comes sweetnes, even an everlasting righteous life, and the never-perishing meats thereof. The Gospel-spirit of Christ, builds up the slain spirit of man, into its own life. Thus is the life and spirit of the law, lawfully used, when offered up in sacrifice, by the spirit of the Gospel. Law-washing reformes and cleanses nature from filth of flesh. Gospel-washing is a death-sanctification upon nature, that regenerates, and cleanses it from filth of spirit, too; and secures from ever returning to filth of flesh.</p>

This spirit brought to their remembrance, or gave them the full understanding of all he said to them, while a fleshly bridegroom, with them. This spirit was not so given, in the law-day, but it was revealed to spiritual saints then, that it would be so given, in the Gospel-day; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 10, 12. Blessed Angels, and saints departed, waited in a sort of confinement, for this opening of the whole mystery of God the father and of Christ, by the man Christ, in the beginning of his Gospel-dispensation. These are things the Angels also desire to look into. The Gospel-dispensation, by the new ministry of the Apostles, properly began, on the effusion of the Gospel-spirit upon them, from Christs ascended humanity; <hi>Act.</hi> 2. Christ, while in the flesh, laid his Gospel-axe to the root of mans fleshly tree, the very principle of all their fruits, brought forth in a first-covenant-life; he preached Gospel-fire and sword to their house on the sand, declaring no such thing as everlasting salvation, ever to be found therein. And for this, they crucified him. Those that take up in the form of Godliness, will make the same tumultuous insurrections against the power of it, in the Servants, as in the Lord and Master. Many high pretenders to Gospel, under the Gospel-day, will be found in perfect contradiction and enmity to the Gospel-faith of spiritual saints, under the dispensation of the law. The inward principle of life, and way of salvation was ever the same, under all dispensations. Never was eternal salvation to be had in the old covenant-life of the law, but new-covenant-life of the Gospel, by Angel or man▪ Not in the old or first-creation, natural state of either, at best; but, new, or second creation state of both, in the spirit of grace. The self-confident <hi>Jews,</hi> in the first, contradicted and blasphemed the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-doctrin of the second; So <hi>Paul</hi> turned from them, to preach it to the <hi>Gentiles; Act.</hi> 13. 45, 46. And this, according to the Lords command, vers. 47. and <hi>Act.</hi> 22. 21. So was he properly a teacher of the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> The means of opening the whole mystery of God, was the slain <hi>Lamb,</hi> in our nature.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> suffered great persecution, singly on this account, his declaring the unsearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able riches of Christ, and whole counsell of God, about the salvation of men. He preached the cross, and death to nature, in the first-covenant life of the law, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensably requisite to their receiving that Gospel-life, that's absolute salvation. This doctrine is so highly offensive to man, that it brings all sorts of opposition and persecution on the heads of those that preach it. But no cause have preachers of Christs Gospel to be ashamed of such their sufferings. For, sayes <hi>Paul, I know whom I have trusted, &amp;c.</hi> He believed or trusted in that spiritual life of Christ, wherein he was inabled to do and bear all things. This all-powerful life he had in him; and therein, knew his spiritual union with Christ, the fountain thereof; So, could do all things, through his strengthning him. <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 13. His Gospel-life, carried him through all variety of condition, his natural man, inward or outward, could be brought into. It instructed him to make a right use of all occurrents, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the will of God. It enabled him, cleerly to understand and obey the voice of God, in all; vers. 11, 12. In the utmost distress within, under the sharp discipline of the cross; or without, from a persecuting world, he was never at a losse. He knew whom he beleeved, and what he had to trust to, that would never fail him, even, Christ in his everlasting righteous Gospel-life, that can answer all his wants, turn a prison into a palace. This kept him from all fear or shame in his utmost sufferings. And he was perswaded also, Christ would keep that which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, against that day. He delivered himself up to Christ, to preserve his own spiritual life, communicated to, and set up in him, by his mighty new-creation-power. He commits himself wholly to Christ, to keep him stedy, in a constant growth and dayly proficiency, under farther revelations and discoveries, therein, till his whole man were brought into a universal obedience to him, in all things▪ This work was too great for <hi>Paul,</hi> while any thing of the foe of his own house, his fleshly or natural mind, hung about him, uncrucified. For, that, being in union with world and devil, hindred the operation of his spiritual, and rebelled against Christ himself; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 15. Under his conduct, and protecting wings, his almighty divine and mighty creature power, he doubts not the being kept safe in his whole spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, soul and body, to his second comming, as he prayed for the <hi>Thessalonians;</hi> 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 5. 23. Spiritual saints, from a sense of their own disability, give up themselvs, into the hands of Christ, to run down all enemies to him and his life, in them, without or within, &amp; strengthen their hand in God.

                  <p>This form of sound words, is the sum of all Gospel-truth, as it is in Jesus. By his Gospel-spirit of truth, he crucified our nature, at best, in the changable life of the law, and so shewed us the way, to that everlasting creature-life, he had with the father, before the world began; <hi>Joh.</hi> 17. 5. All that has been done and suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christ, in that variety of creature-nature, wherein Priest and Sacrifice, is the substance of all sound Gospel-words or doctrine. All life, all wisdom and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, divine and creaturely, are treasured up in him. The man Christ, setting open the mystery of his divine and everlasting creature-fellowship, makes up, declares and communicates the unsearchable riches of his person. This is the form of sound words, in which the true preaching of the Gospel does consist; a full witness to Christs person, and, therein, a cleer declaration of Gods whole mind and counsel, for the salvation of men. All this, <hi>Paul</hi> having declared to <hi>Timothy,</hi> charges him to hold it fast, with that faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. <hi>Paul</hi> saw such a spiritual faith in <hi>Timothy,</hi> as in his mother <hi>Eunice,</hi> and grandmother <hi>Lois,</hi> amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the actual birth of spiritual life. By this, he knew <hi>Timothy,</hi> fitted to obey this fatherly counsell of his, in holding fast his Gospel-testimony, so as to admit nothing contrary thereunto. He was bound, with <hi>Paul,</hi> to commit himself wholly to Christs conduct, for the safe keeping his whole person, and that unchangable good thing, his unspeakable gift of spiritual life, in him, and to cause his daily thriving and growth therein, by his more abundant revelation or discoveries of himself to him. This charg is <hi>Timothy</hi> to observe, answerable to his faith in, and love to Christ, begotten by <hi>Pauls</hi> Gospel-ministry. His holding all sound Gospel-words fast, imports a faithful obedience to them, as well as declaration of them. to others; least when he has preached them to others, he himself should be a cast-away, as <hi>Paul</hi> sayes of himself; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. 27.

                     <hi>Paul</hi> here continues his advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> for keeping the good thing commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; shewing him the way and means of so doing, even by the holy Ghost which dwelleth in us. The good thing to be so warily kept, is the incorruptible seed of God, quickned up into its own spiritual life, peculiar activity and operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This is committed to saints, and they know they have it by its own self-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencing demonstration. Their conscience beares them witness in the holy Ghost they have it, and live in obedience to Christ, in it. His spirit undeniably witnesses to and with their spirit, that in this newness of life, they are the sons of God, and bring forth fruit unto God; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 16. <hi>and</hi> 6. 4. Spiritual life is the highest
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:206287:74"/> kind of creature-life, and gives the most satisfying, undeniable demonstration of its self, by its own self-evidencing fruits and operations; by the fruits of it in saints, love, joy, peace, <hi>&amp;c. (Gal.</hi> 5. 22, 23.) and the fruits they, therein, bring forth to God. Bodily, the lowest sort of life, in man, gives undisputable demonstration of it self, by its proper opperations and performances. Yet higher, first-covenant righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous life, in mans natural spirit, does by its righteous workings and fruits, carry its own self-evidencing demonstration. Yet these fruits are but such, by which, the tree that beares them, and root whence they grow, may be known to be but flesh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But though spiritual life carry a stronger and cleerer demonstration of its self, then either of these, to the saint himself, and others, in the same awakened princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, yet it lies wholly hid from man, in the cleerest and strongest exercise of the other two lives, bodily, or first-covenant righteous. All that, is downright darkness, as to the discerning of spiritual life, or any of the things, fruits, words, or concerns there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The spiritual life, knowledg, and discerning of the true saint, with all he sees, are utterly invisible to man, in the highest wisdom of his own nature; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 14, 15. The spiritual man sees the natural, with all his things, and knows what all amount unto, but is not, at all, judged or discerned by the natural, in his spiritual life, light, or things thereof. The very Gospel-root and principle of his life, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning and action, is utterly denied, as a meer fiction. The seed of this Gospel-life, being wakened up into life and motion, in <hi>Timothy,</hi> by <hi>Pauls</hi> ministry, he advises him, as a father, to stir up the said gift, and pay universal obedience to Christ, therein. And all this, <hi>By the holy Ghost that dwelleth in us;</hi> that is <hi>in Paul, Timothy</hi> and other Gospel-saints. Tis the holy anointing, from the fountain-spirit of all Gospel-life in Christs person, quickens up the seed of it, in saints; and it is the same holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit in Christ, that by its continual hoverings over, droppings and influencings upon the saints, nourishes and strengthens the said life, handing the saint along, into a continual proficiency and growth, from spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual infancy or babe-ship, to a strong young man, and, at length, to a spiritual Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship and father-hood, in Christ, as <hi>John</hi> distinguishes; 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 12, 14. This progresse to a full stature of spiritual life, is figuratively signified by bodily, in the seed, embryo, quickning, and then actual birth of the litteral Child, and then growth, step by step, to a perfect state of bodily life and strength. All along his spiritual growth, is the saint to keep closs, under Christs protecting wings, and cherishing influence. For, his growth in spiritual life, as well as first quickning into it, is by the holy Ghost, or spirit of Christ, in himself. The same spirit, or hand that first cast in the royal seed of the kingdom-life into them, and then quickened it up in them, must flutter over them, as an Eagle over her young, to protect, cherish, preserve and carry them through all difficulties and dangers; <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 11, 12. The saints only way to keep this good thing committed unto him, is to commit himself and it, back again to Christ, and keep closs and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, under the protecting shadow and nourishing influence of his divine and crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Paul</hi> strengthens his advice to <hi>Timothy,</hi> by shewing the sad consequents of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers turning from those Gospel-truths, they were, once, by conviction, of the same perswasion with him, about; and that, through his Gospel-teaching. They were bewitch'd back, with the <hi>Galatians,</hi> to the fading life, Glory and riches of their own nature, in holy flesh, or a first-covenant state of righteousnes. A fixed setting up in that life of the law (Christ sacrificed in himself, when convincingly shew'd that Gospel-life into which he translated our nature, out of that death) excluds all future benefit of his sacrifice, and leaves men nothing to expect but final wrath and fiery indignation. In love to their own spirit of nature, they do wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full despite to his Gospel-spirit of grace. So are gone, for ever, without remedy; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 29. After they have received the knowledg of his Gospel-life and truth, by its own light, they do thus wilfully and unpardonably sin against it, hate, and utterly reject it. They that take not <hi>Paul's</hi> advice, in a carefull keeping the unchangably good thing, committed to them, or shew'd and offer'd them, do apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>statize from it, and forsake them that declar'd such Gospel-truth, to them. They betake themselves to the wisdom of man, set up by Christ's first-covenant communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, in them, as the teacher and judg of what they ought to do, for salvation. That wisdom of man, though received from Christ himself, in the first covenant, is moer. foolishnes to the wisdom of God, in the second. When men therefore resolve to follow that blind leader, they are wholly for man's other Gospel, in a spirit of lying divination, and so are led to the chambers of death. <hi>Paul</hi> instantly turned from that wisdom of flesh, in himself, when the wisdom of God was brought to light, in him; <hi>Gal.</hi> 1. 16. He lean'd not to his own understanding, any longer, but follow'd and trusted in the Lord's new-creature-wisdom and light, for directing his steps; <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. 5, 6. The following mans own wisdom, in this case, is the forsaking Christs, and all his Gospel truths, or words thereof. Many followers of Christ, in a temporary Gospel-faith, or spiritual light (which for a season, they followed) apostatized from him, and walked no more with him; <hi>Joh</hi> 6. 66. They would not bear his hard sayings, his cross-doctrin. His fiery gospel-doctrine, on their holy flesh, they retreated from, into the cool shade of a worldly Church, under their old, Pharisaical teachers. If mans wisdom be admitted judg in the case, it will be for mans holding his own, against the cross of Christ, saying, 'tis good for him to be here. Will Christ destroy a righteous life of his own setting up, twice, in us, first by creation, and then by redemption? Beleeve it, that will. A world of consequential reasonings, a pompous flood of arguments, in this case, will not suffer mans under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, backed with Satans serpentine subtleties, to look after Christs Gospel-life, any more. As many, thus, forsook Christ himself; would walk no more with him, hear or regard him, so did many forsake <hi>Paul.</hi> True Gospel-preachers are not to confide in any, as steddy followers of Christ and them, in first-covenant life,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:206287:75"/> or second covenant light, short of the very Gospel-life thereof. Christ would not commit himself to such. He sufficiently knew, what a fickle, versatile thing man is, within the compasse of his own nature, however adorned with Gospel-light, or spiritual gifts; <hi>Jo.</hi> 2. 23, 24. Rightly qualified Gospel-teachers, are, in some good measure, enabled to distinguish truly principled Gospel-friends, from bare conviction professours of the Gospel, who are yet liable to such apostasy, as admits no repentance; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 6. If man, by following his own wisdom, in the first-covenant-life of the law, walk contrary to Gods, and all the Gospel-words thereof, God will walk contrary to him; <hi>Levit.</hi> 26. 21. 23, 24. And where is man then? Has he an arm like God? <hi>All nations are lesse then nothing, before him.</hi> Walking contrary to God, is called in the margin, a walking at all adventures, with him; <hi>Lev.</hi> 26. This is done, when they chuse to walk in the unsteddy principles of the first-covenant-life, in their own renewed nature, rather then in his constant, steddy. Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness. True saints must be content to have the spirit of Christ their guide and teacher, even the Holy Ghost, the determiner of all truth, and only safe directer of their steps.</p>

                     <hi>PAul</hi> owns <hi>Timothy,</hi> as in the grace of Christ, his son; so as a father, gives this faithful advice to him, by way of exhortation, to growstrong therein. This grace, was the everlasting righteous life of Christs Gospel-spirit, communicated to, and set up in <hi>Timothy,</hi> in distinction from the life of the law, set up by the first-creation, in man, which, with all the glory and old fading things thereof, is to be done away. They that preach up this, for salvation, are ministers but of the old testament or first covenant, which, with all the things thereof, is but letter, type, or shadow of the second, and all its substantiall things and truths. This new Testament or covenant▪ was <hi>Paul</hi> the minister of. The letter, or first, preached up, and rested in▪ for salvation, to the utter exclusion and rejection of the second, killeth; runs man, irrecoverably, into eternal death. But, the Gospel-spirit and principle of the second, gives, and is eternal life, to all obedient receivers and walkers therein; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. The spirit of the second, speaks death to the very principle of the first, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dispensable means for receiving the life of the second. And, in this, when received, are true saints, by wary and constant walking, and waiting for Christs farther com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications, therein, to wax stronger and stronger, dayly. They that preach up letter, or old testament-life, as everlasting salvation, kill and destroy their hearers, by their lies and falshoods, while they warrant and perswade them to hope, they will confirm or make good their word. All such preaching is a lying divination, a false prophecy; all they see and preach up for salvation, is but vanity. All first-covenant life, wisdom, glory, righteousness, are but vanishing shadows of the second, the everlasting life, wisdom, glory, and righteousness of God. Man in honour, at
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:206287:76"/> his best estate, in the former, is altogether vanity. That, in true saints, is in the wane, continually decreasing and going off, as they encrease and wax stronger in the latter. This, <hi>John Baptist</hi> testifies, as to the utmost product of his law-mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stry in men, in order to their encrease in Christs Gospel-life; <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 30. <hi>I must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease, he must encrease.</hi> They only that so preach, shew the way of salvation. <hi>Timothies</hi> waxing strong in the Gospel-spirit of grace, would be attended with the decrease and weakning of his spirit of nature, as to the life of law. To keep man strong, fixed and established in the righteous life of the law, is satans de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign and work upon him, in order to fix him with himself, in unchangable enmity to the Gospel. A growing strong in the grace of Christ, <hi>Paul</hi> knew to be the only way, for weakning and mortifying the fleshly or natural mind, in himself, and more carefully watching against all the anti-gospel doctrine or words thereof, in others. <hi>Paul</hi> knew, by experience, the dangerous counter-workings of the natural or fleshly mind, against the spiritual, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. And he knew, the stronger the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual grows, the weaker the fleshly, and so, by degrees, this dangerous opposition of flesh against spirit, wears off, and, at length, quite ceases by the compleat death of the foe of our own house. All the most charming desireables to nature, with the utmost skill of satan, in managing them, signify nothing, when the worldly spirit in us, is dead, which alone can be taken with them, and we found in a spirit that sees the vanity of them, and is fixed on things eternal. When our own spirit or nature is fully crucified, in the will and desire thereof, all danger is over, and our deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from worldly snares and satanick delusions, compleated. <hi>Paul</hi> found such ease, and deliverance, by the Gospel-spirit of the cross, on his natural, that he says, <hi>God forbid, I should Glory in any thing, save the cross of Christ, by which, the world is crucified to me, and I to the world; Gal.</hi> 6. 14. The Gospel-spirit conqueres all, within and without the saints, that is found in enmity thereto. It makes the saint, in conclusion, more then a conquerour; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 37. It begins its conquest, at home, within doors, on the very spirit of the saint, at best, in the most righteous life of the law. This, once finished, world and divel can make nothing of it, with them, for ever after. The grace of Christ in saints, is their spiritual, all powerfull weapon of war. The stronger they grow in it, the more able to fight down, what ever presumptuously exalts it self against it. Though saints walk in the flesh, they do not war after, but against the flesh, with all its carnal weapons, by spiritual; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 3, 5. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore exhorts <hi>Timothy</hi> to wax strong in that grace, which is his only security, against all enemies, dangers, and deaths.</p>

                  <p>A being strong in the grace of Christ, would fit to obey this further word of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation. <hi>Paul</hi> knew his Gospel-testimony, offensive to man. So, would prepare him to meet and deale with all sorts of hardship, without shrinking or starting back from any service to Christ, come what will or can, by the combined oppositions of devils and men. He must reckon upon the losse of that life, in the service of Christ, as the mysterious way, by which himself and all his stout souldiers, conquer and triumph over all enemies; <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 14. <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 15. All life, that can be lost, must be lost by the saint, before his spiritual warfare be ended, and he fully at home with the Lord. The true saints Profession, is war. The enemies he is to encounter, is flesh and blood in himself, and other men; and, yet higher, evil Angelical princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers. The carnal mind, or will, at best, is the saints most dangerous, though not most potent enemy. It is, in union with world and devil, continually warring against their spiritual mind; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. Flesh and blood also in other men, corrupt or righteous, in conjunction with Angelical powers of darkness, to carry on the mystery of iniquity against the mystery of Godliness, are to be dealt with, in this war.

The spirit of man, corrupt or righteous, is, in its whole worldly life, desire and thought, the most dangerous enemy, he is to engage and fight against, in this war. World and devil, without, will be at a totall losse, as to the casting any chain or snare on the saints, when their friend, and his foe, within, is slain. And this is required by the spiritual law of the cross. Whoever therefore are for gratifying the natural belly and desire, in any kind, after, by Gospel light, shewed their true concern, are enemies to the cross, lovers of the world, and friends of the devil, who is wholly for gratifying and keeping up, what Christ is for pulling down and destroying, in men, as the undispensable means of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing saved. The true souldier of Christ, must eye the great Captain of salvation, set himself wholly to follow his example and obey his command, in order to the victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in his service. He must, by the death of all in him, that satan can gratify, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come him. He must crucify that fleshly mind in him, that satan can please; and walk in that spirit of Christ, that can perfectly overcome flesh, world, and devil; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 24, 25.

Saints receive no hurtfull wounds from enemies, in this fight, by their persecuting enmity and wrathful blowes▪ given to their natural man, which is all they can hit; but, by gratifying the desires thereof, with their charming vanities. Their kisses and flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are the only dangerous wounds. All their angry blows at them, do but hasten the brusing that heel in them, that makes way for their final breaking all their enemies heads, and trampling them under their feet, in the Gospel power or spirit of their great Lord General.</p>

And this, by bringing their body or natural man into subjection, which evidences the power they run and fight in, to be the Gospel-spirit of Christ. The body of whole natural man, in the saint, is by this all-powerful spirit of Christ, to be fought down, and brought un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, as an enemy, in its own whole life, course, will, and way; and so, fetched over into Christs party, in due subjection to, and harmony with the spiritual mind of Christ, in him. All that run, sight and strive, in the activity and power of their renewed natural spirit, do not run or strive lawfully for the true prize, or incorrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble crown; nor ever will find it. Many will thus seek and strive to enter in at the strait gate and not be able. Those that aim to reign as Kings, with the rich and ful <hi>Corinthians,</hi> or bewitched <hi>Galatians,</hi> in holy flesh, satan is ready to establish and crown them there, in a state of unchangable enmity to God, and his Gospel-spirit.

Such mystical kings or princes of this world, crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Christ, because he would not king it with them there. That, they keep up for king, is to be crucified, in order to any mans reigning with Christ, or being saved. The lawfull striving for the true crown and prize, is the denial of mans own will, through-out, as to any thing that is worldly; yea, the giving up his whole changable state of life, in sacrifice to God. So will he be temperate, moderate, and sober, in a sinless use of worldly necessaries, without any thing of inordinate affection. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that strive in their own will, and forbidden life, strive in a direct rebellion against God and Christ, and union with the devil. <hi>They enter not by the door into the sheep-fold, but climb up another way.

So did he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complish the will of God declared in Scripture, by sacrificing our changable nature, at best, and raising it into that unchangable creature-life, that's in unchangable union with the divine. And by this entring with our nature into the spiritual life and Glory he had with his Father, in his everlasting righteous creature-spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world was <hi>(Prov.</hi> 8 22, 23.) did he both set open, and actually pour forth the same, on his followers.

He that is the glorious object, gives the eye suited thereunto. Else, still, all would be invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible. His revealing himself to us, is the setting up and opening an understanding in us, that can take his discoveries. The man Christ, as possessed of all divine and creature-life and glory, is the adaequate Object of spiritual faith, for Saints ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting salvation. And he declares it his Fathers pleasure, he should give eternal life, to them.

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:206287:81"/> required by the spiritual law of God, to be designed in greatest love, from God, for his highest good. For the life he requires our ceasing from, by death, can never make us truly happy: yea, in the highest restored righteousness of it, since the fall, is found in direct enmity to that, which can. God therefore takes away that faulty first-covenant-life, by the Cross, that he may give us the second. By the death of that, that's in enmity to God and their true good, he gives that which will make them the friends of God, and for ever blessed. They that die with Christ in the first, shall live with him in the second. The ground and reason why God requires the one, is to qualify and capacitate us, for receiving the other. If conformed to Christ in his death, as to the former life, we shall be like him in the second, by resurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 5. That the only way to gain the latter, is the obedient losing the former, Christ has written out, in his own exemplary practice. Sharing with Christ in the latter, abundantly over-recompences all loss in the former. This true Gospel-traffique, the exchange of a temporal life for eternal, is the highest gain imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. Law-traffique with Satan, in selling or parting with all regard or hopes of the latter, when convincingly shewed and offered, to be established in the former, is the greatest loss imaginable; eternal death to all such foolish Merchants. The san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying death-touch of Christs Gospel-spirit on our natural, Law-spirit, sublimates and transforms us into a life, transcendently more excellent than man or angel were possessed of, by the first-creation.</p>
                  <p>By this, are men made joynt-heirs with Christ, of God. By suffering with him, in that Life, they never can be so; they'l be raised into that, wherein they ever will be so; <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 17. <hi>If they suffer with him, they shall be glorified with him.</hi> The death of our narrow mortal state, makes way for that extended new-creation capacity, that qualifies for the enjoyment of such high blessedness. God himself becomes our lot and inheritance, in the vision of his divine glory. This can no other wise be given or received, but in Christs everlasting creature-life: and this no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise partaken of, than by death of our natural state, at best. If we die with him in our mortal, first-covenant life, we live with him in his immortal, second-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant life. The joy of this latter, set before us, should cause us to rejoyce in all the hard discipline on us, in the former. This is one of the faithful and true sayings of Christs spiritual Law of the Cross, upon nature, at best. Others follow.</p>

                  <p>Saints suffering with Christ, is the only appointed way for reigning with him. Christ took our nature, at best, and sacrificed it.

In Law-sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, clean beasts, God had no pleasure. They were but instructing types of the Gospel-sacrifice. Christs obedience to his Father, herein, was a teaching example to his followers, who can, no otherwise, passe into the glory he now is in, then he

Nor will Christ spare his children, the Father has given him. That life they cannot reign with him, must go, for that, in which they can. In the former they cannot see the whole mind of God in the scriptures, nor steddily obey that little they see. In the latter, they are infallible seers of the whole mind, and doers of the whole will of God. Man walks but after his own heart, in the first-covenant: after Gods, only in the second. Christ himself declars, he took the first, to suffer, being but that in which he could do nothing; and, that in the second, his Father had committed all rule and judgment to him. The son can do nothing of himself in his first-covenant life of the law; Then addes, <hi>The Father judges no man.</hi> Who then must judg?

And by passive obedience with him, in the first (which is the highest obedience per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable therewith) can saints be brought to perform active obedience, with him, to Gods wel-pleasing, and their salvation, in the second. If they so suffer with him, under satans and mans reign, in the former, they shall appear with him in the visible glory of the latter, at his reign, in the sight of all enemies. They must lose the former life, in the highest wisdom whereof, they know not what they worship or do: in the latter, they fully know his mind and do his will.

                  <p>All strivings and disputings for the life of the law against the Gospel, are profane and vain babblings. They that so do, after Gospel-conviction, manifest themselves, to be subverted, and labour to subvert others, by turning them from the Gospel-life and doctrine of Christ. All their labour, herein, is wilful rebellion against the known command of God. And, as a farther aggravation of their folly and madnes, they strive, under, a known impossibility of ever finding what they pretend to seek, eternal life, in the principles of a fading mortal state. By this vain babbling, obsti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natly persisted in, they will encrease unto more ungodliness; under the form of godliness, dayly multiplying their rebellious actings against the power thereof, till absolutely and unpardonably fixed, in enmity thereunto. Such babbling is also cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed profane, as managed in a known enmity and daring opposition to God himself. An absolute fixure in this course, is the highest pitch of profanes and ungodliness, they can, most unhappily, arrive at.</p>

                  <p>Her's an account of the said prophane mind of vain babblers, in the persons, here mentioned. Their word or whole expression of their evil mind, eats as a canker or gangreen, which, in letter, is a dangerous disease, of an over-spreading nature, corrupting every part, and so destroying the whole body. A mind, thus corrupted from the simplicity that is in Christ (or single chast eye to his Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness and truth, by lusting after the forbidden fruit, satan offers to gratify them with, in the first covenant life of their own spirit) does more and more corrupt them, causing them to encrease in spiritual wickedness, till grown to a fu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>l stature in the spirit of the devil. Thus does this mystical canker, poison and corrupt the spirit of man, step by step, till the top-stone be laid, in unchangable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God. Such were <hi>Hymeneus</hi> and <hi>Philetus,</hi> who erred concerning the truth, which implies their former acknowledgment of it. Their errour was, that the resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection is past, already. This shews, their own faith in Christs Gospel-spirit of truth, under Gospel-light, destroyed in them, and their endeavour to corrupt and destroy others, also. They hold the resurrection, already past, or that they have the true resurrection life, and so, absolute salvation, in the first-covenant-life, to the utter exclusion of the second. On this most false hypothesis, all true Gospel-preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is vain, and faith built thereon, nothing; and all perish that relie upon it; so, are of all men most miserable. For, they quit all other life and things, for a Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-state, which, if a fable, they are gone on all hands, in this world and next, too. Thus <hi>Paul</hi> argues; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 12, 19. But, says he, Christ is risen, out of the death of that, they call a resurrection-state, into that which indeed is so, which the faith of all saints is built upon. Consequently, the denying this, overthrows the faith and salvation of all true saints, and all the witness, given in the spirit of Christ, thereto. But they that thus say, will themselvs, in conclusion, be found of all men, most miserable, as the greatest and worst of all sinners. True saints Gospel-doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, races the sandy foundation, and pulls up the roots of all their false hopes of salvation, in the first-covenant: and they race the foundation and pull up by the roots, what in them lies, all their hopes of blessedness, in the second. Thus are Christs true, and mans false Gospel, in point-blank contradiction, in every word, striking at the very root of all one anothers hopes of salvation. True Gospel-prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, with <hi>Paul,</hi> declare two things: First, that Christ died, as to the first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant life of the law, in our nature; and, secondly, that he raised it into the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life of the second. His death atoned for the sin of all man-kind, in the first. But a far higher end of his death, was the raising our nature, into an everlasting riglyeous life, in the second <hi>Adam;</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 1, 4. This is the testimony of the
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:206287:84"/> spirit of God, through-out the whole scripture; that Christ should thus take our nature, and by the death of it, in the first, raise it into the life of the second cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. That earthly life of the law, man paeaches salvation in, Christs Gospel-spirit speaks fire and sword, war and death, to. This earthly life, and mans earthen vessel or spirit, therein, is found in enmity to Christs heavenly, Gospel-spirit, which is filth of spirit, no otherwise to be cleansed, but by breaking the earthen, vessel, as was typed, <hi>Levit.</hi> 11. 33. Those that thus deny the true Gospel resurrection-life, go to work another way, for interpreting all such Gospel-words, as cross, death, regeneration, resurrection, <hi>&amp;c:</hi> The cross of Christ, they reckon falls upon the corrupt spirit and life of nature, and quickens man up into the lost righteous life thereof. Heres their death, regeneration and resurrection. So, in the but restor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed first-covenant-life, they say, the resurrection, and so all bitternes of death, is past, as <hi>Agag</hi> said, when death was at his door. Here's the utmost extent of death and resurrection, they'l allow the scripture to mean. So, fortify themselvs against all Gospel-doctrine. They reckon, they have got all, in their restored life of the law. Though this life was changable in the first <hi>Adam,</hi> yet, when restored by the second, unchangable. This they say, though the second <hi>Adam</hi> crucified this very life, in his own person, and evidently set himself before their eys, in Gospel-light, as crucified, therein. Thus does satan winde his serpentine head into them, and as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures them, they are now possessed of Christ, to all intents and purposes, for ever. All is safe; <hi>Ye shall not die at all.</hi> Man aims at establishment here, which is not the second <hi>Adams</hi> counsell to him, nor workmanship in him; but, satans. So come they to a fixed reprobate or undiscerning mind, as to all spiritual, Gospel, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly things and truths, once by them known. This sort of sinners, that in first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant life, and second covenant light, have known their masters will, shall be beaten with many stripes, fall under a sorer condemnation and wrath, then fixed sinners of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in filth of flesh, that did not so know it. They reckon themselvs conformable to Christ, in his death; when nothing is subdued in them, that Christ ever had, in him. The corrupt state and spirit of our nature he never took, or had. For then had he not been a spotles Lamb, for sacrifice. And as to the life, in which they reckon themselvs past the cross, and death, in the resurrection; this is that, Christ crucified in the unstained purity of it, in himself. In the highest career of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to his cross, are they. They have followed him, but for mystical loaves, to feed at his first-covenant table, for adorning their own nature. They will not follow this Lamb, whither-soever he goes, through the death of this, into his everlasting creature-life; <hi>Jo.</hi> 6, 26, 27. There they leave him; turn back, and walk no more or farther with him. The defign of this ruining errour, is, to secure natures head from the cross and Gospel-sword of Christ. When nature is healed of the deadly wound, by the first sin, they'l hear of no death-blow upon it, again, as necessary to eternal life. Not a word of such doctrine will be listened to. Thus did such teachers overthrow the faith of some, in <hi>Pauls</hi> time; turned them from a faith in Christs Gospel-life; as <hi>Elymas</hi> would the <hi>Deputy</hi> of <hi>Cyprus.</hi> By saying the resurrection is past, in first-covenant-life, they deny the true resurrection-state,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:206287:85"/> in the second. These are the mystical Sorcerers, Whormongers, Murderers, and Idolaters, that make, love, and set up their lie, or accursed Gospel, in enmity to the true, which excludes them for ever, from entring into the new<hi>-Jerusalem-</hi>City or Kingdom, <hi>Rev.</hi> 22. 15.</p>

                     </gap>ce, as a third thing, Saints are required to depart from all iniquity. To the first, This is Christs new name, importing that new-creature-life, it belong, to. This name is distinct from that he had, as son of man on earth, in the fleshly life of the law. This new name and life of Jesus of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> is that, in which alone, any can be saved; <hi>Act.</hi> 4. 12. In his other, he refused to be a King. In this, he will reign, over all▪ In this name and life, is he the son of God, in whom he is wel-pleased; 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. In this name, is he God the father's sealed one; <hi>Jo.</hi> 6. 27. And this new life and name derived to, and put upon saints, brings them under the same approbation-seal. They, in that life, do alwayes those things that please his and their Father. The perishing first covenant-life, neverhad God's seal; nor man, therefore, true salvation in it. To the second. What's the naming this name of Christ? The owning of it, when by Christs convincing discoveries, revealed to us; So as to quit our name in a first-covenant life, for it. As the fruit of this, are we to depart from iniquity. First, What is meant by iniquity? Secondly by departing from it? To the first, Iniquity signifies not only the sinful state of mans degenerate nature, with all the desire, thought, word, action and evil fruits there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, without God, Christ, or hope, in the world. All this is filth of flesh. But there is another and more mischievous sort of iniquity, called filth of spirit, in the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:206287:85"/> renewed, righteous life of nature, even enmity to God and his everlasting righteous Gospel-spirit. Those that own the new name of Christ, are to depart from both these sorts of iniquity, all iniquity; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1. And this imports a departure out of the very life of our nature, at best, in which enmity to God is so deeply rooted, as never to be slain, but life and all must go, for that everlasting Gospel-life, that makes men, with <hi>Abraham,</hi> the friends of God, for ever. The keeping up a first-covenant life, in a known opposition to the second, loses all. This is the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sin against the Holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit. But he that is shewed Christs Gospel-life, by Gospel-light, and hopes to be partaker thereof, must purify himself, as Christ is pure (1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 3. 3.) <hi>Be holy as God is holy; Pet.</hi> 1. 15, 16. The death of nature, at best, in order to receive the everlasting life of Christs Gospel-spirit, is the only way to be so.</p>

                  <p>The whole world and all creatures in it, are Gods great House and Houshold, his own workmanship; created and maintained by him, and owe the service of their beings, to him. The Lord is the soveraign Potter, that has made them all, of the same lump, some to honour, others to dishonour; <hi>Ro.</hi> 9. 21. Angels and men, in the immortality of their beings, are these mystical Vessels of honour and dishonour. All men, in the changable, mortal life of the law, are of one lump of mystical clay, in the image of the earthy, as first-created in the righteousness of their natural beings. This mortal life of their immortal spirit, as wel as the life of their bodies, with the receptive subjects of both, are charactred as made out of a lump of clay, wherein all are alike. But, here is a further thing. In this great House, or World, there are not only Vessels of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver, but of Wood and Earth.</hi> By the distinguishing hand of God towards men, and their distinguishing demeanour towards him, some become Vessels of <hi>Gold and Silver; and some, of Wood and Earth.</hi> Consequently, several uses are made of them. Some are appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to honour, and some to dishonour. The free gift of Christs immortal new-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture life, makes the difference of the vessels of mystical Gold and Silver, from those of Wood and Earth, according to his pleasure. New-creature or Gospel-life of immortality, is Gods own, that 'tis lawful to give to whom he will, as the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>questionable prerogative of his absolute power and soveraignty. New-creature life, is Gods own life, set up by his immediate divine workmanship, from everlast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in unchangable union with his divine; <hi>Pro.</hi> 8. 22, 23. 30. This everlasting new-covenant life, God calls his own, in distinction from changable, first-covenant life, set up in men and Angels, by the first creation, which he calls their own. They are the work-manship of that creating creature-spirit, in Christ, that was it self the immediate workmanship of the divine. They were created in the changable, earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, shadowy image of Gods righteousness, perfect, in its kind, by the unchangable creature-image thereof. This changable righteous first-covenant life of the law,
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:206287:86"/> as set up in man by creation, or restored by redemption, is called man's own; though by God put upon him, and set up in him; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 14, 15.

                     </gap> comes into the world, which is first-covenant light, he gives them the prospect and view of that first-covenant righteous life, they were created in, and a power of returning there into, if they will. A restored freedom of will, attending such general light, capacitates all men, for a return into that kind of life, they were created in, which therefore is called the common and general salvation or deliverance out of the fall. Millions of men, do, notwithstanding all this, wilfully brutify themselvs, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in the unruly lusts, unbridled passions, madnesses, and extravagancies of their degenerate nature, making their sensual, bestial powers, masters of their rational, so as to force those that should be their rulers, to truckle under them▪ and become serviceable, to prog and cast about, how to fetch in provision, to gratify the lusts thereof. But some men make another choice, to have their rational powers masters of the sensual, which, while short of a first-covenant knowledg, and union with Christ, makes a moral honest Heathen. If this rise to a covenant-union with Christ, it makes a legal-Christian professour, in a state of common salvation. In all this, mans will is the chuser, and actour. But, as to special, everlasting salvation, the case is far otherwise. There, 'tis not of him that willeth, or runneth, in the activity, life, and power of his own will, but meerly and singly, of Gods will, who shews this great mercy to whom he please, in the unspeakable gift of everlasting, new-creation life; <hi>Ro.</hi> 9▪ 15, 16. The death of mans will, at best, a cessation from all the life and motion thereof, is undispensably required, as the only way and means, for partaking of, or receiving this unspeakable gift, the Gospel-pearl, that makes men, Gods Jewels; <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. 17. By the fresh setting up of first-covenant light and life, in man, by way of restoration, his mystical house, or immortal spirit, is reduced, in good degree, into its first-created order. Sensual powers in it, are brought into a dutifull subjection to, and orderly comportment towards the superiour, governing, rational powers. But all this comliness and order, amounts but to the form of godliness, and righteousness of man, in the restored shadowy, earthly image of God, the first man was created in. All this therefore, set and kept up, in a presum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuous competition with, and opposition to the life and image of the heavenly, and the power of Godliness, or righteousness of God, therein, is turned into an idol of jealousy, and becoms the root of all mystical uncleanesses, spiritual whordoms, idolatries and abominations, in enmity to Gods divine, and everlasting creature-life; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 15. And, accordingly will they be deal with▪ that so do; vers. 38. All, man is or can do, in his own first-creation life, at best, has nothing to do, in the case of everlasting salvation; availes not any thing towards it <hi>(Gal.</hi> 6. 15.) is no motive or argument, at all, with God, for the bestowing of it. God requires a cessation from all freedom, life and motion of mans own will, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive this unspeakable gift and mercy, from Gods own will.</p>
                  <p>While then, self-confident man reckon's, he bids fair for eternal life, with the young man, in the most fruitful activity of his own nature, in the restored first-covenant
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:206287:86"/> life thereof, he is in a flat-contrariety to God's thoughts, in the case, and to all the faithful sayings of his spiritual law. For this requires the obedient losing of that life, at best, with all the things thereof, in order to receive his newness of life, wherein to reign. Tis not in the nature of man, or any thing possible to be done in it, but by and in the grace of God, any are eternally saved; <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. 8. All, done by man in his own nature, will and way, with the very root or Principle there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, all this must go, root and branch, the tree with the fruit, that we may receive that Gospel-spirit of grace, wherein alone we can be saved. This is eternal life, and the Kingdom of Heaven within men. Thus, all mans boasting and glorying is gone. The Lord has the whole Glory of his being saved. Is it not better for man to be saved, so as God may have all the Glory, then go boasting, and glorying in his holy flesh, to the chambers of eternal death? Is it not better to follow the slain lamb, in the halt, blind, maimed, yea fully crucified nature, into the kingdom of God, then to be cast into hell, whole, and unbroken by the Gospel-cross? <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. 29, 30. The immortal spirits and beings of Saints, by the single and double portion of Christ's Gospel-life of immortality, may fitly be resembled by those more excellent, durable mettals, silver and gold, as vessels of honour, fit for their masters use, in his new-creation temple, or sanctuary. These vessels of Gold and Silver, are distinguished in Gods great house, the first-creation-world, from those of wood and earth. Wood and earth fitly signify Angels and men, in their natural, first-cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation make and purity of a first-covenant life. They were all but leaky vessels, and the life they were possessed of, unstable as water, a perishing vanity. How soon did all men, in and with the first, lose the water of a first-covenant life, and wine also of spiritual light, by which they saw the new-covenant-life of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> in the typpical tree thereof. Mans immortal spirit, was the leaky, earthen vessel, that soon rendered it self, by its foolish choice, a broken Cistern, that could hold neither the said mystical water, or wine, put into it, by the creatour. He chose his own life, and the gratifying of that, in which himself was represented to himself, by the tree of good and evil, preaching to him, that he was yet possessed but of such good from God, as might be turned into evil by his own fault; this he chose, in preference to the everlasting Gospel-life of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> preached to him, in the tree of life. That he got, by this folly, was the losse of both, and all. So, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came dead, as to all righteous life of God or man. The flaming sword, turning every way, does now so keep the way of the tree of life, that no man can come to eat thereof, but he must passe under this sword; <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 24. This sword is the living word of God <hi>(Heb.</hi> 4. 12.) Christs new-creature Gospel-spirit of the crosse, that both kills, and offers up mans nature, in the mystical flames thereof, and so puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies and transforms mans first-creation earthen vessel, into new-creation gold, and silver. The same hand, of the great mystical potter that demolishes mans first built, moulds &amp; fashions him, by a new-creation, into a spiritual vessel, or newbottle, fitted to hold the new-wine, or spirit of the kingdom. The priestly, gospel-spirit of Christ, plucks out &amp; cuts off mans right eye, hand, and foot, takes away his best understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and power of working righteousness or walking righteously, in the first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-life
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:206287:87"/> of his own nature, in order to give him his own new eye or understanding, a new hand or power of working righteousness, and set him upon a new foot, for walking uprightly, according to the Gospel, in all wel-pleasing to God. A new spiritual principle of life and action, does thenceforward become the root, from which he brings forth fruit unto God. This newness of life, can never be merited by any thing man can do in his former, which is called oldness of letter▪ God offers his own new-creature life, to all men. None misse it, but they that so prefer their own, before it, so as to keep it up, in unchangable opposition to it: None, but, they that prefer their earthen vessels and life, as Angels their wooden ones, to that fountain of living waters, Christs Gospel-spirit of everlasting life, which makes whom God pleases, vessels of Gold and Silver, vessels of honour, immortality and eternal life. All men and Angels were capacitated by the immortality of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, to be vessels of honour, in an immortality of life. But God makes some of them, so. Others, by their own fault, and then by Gods just judgment upon them, are made vessels of dishonour and everlasting contempt. Silver and Gold, vessels of honour, signify an elected number of men, and then a selected number out of the elect, that have the double portion of Christs spiritual-creature-life. They are all filled with living waters, from the fountain, according to their distinct spiritual ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacities. The double-portioned saint, is capacitated for neerer approaches to, and fuller enjoyments of the infinite divinity; as possessed of a portion in the supream and most heavenly part of Christs new-creature life. Such are vessels of Gold. Others, possessed only of the Glorified earthly part thereof, are signified by vessels of Silver. Thus, in the litteral Sanctuary, the nearer God, or the holy of holies, the most holy figurative place, the more precious were the materials and workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. <hi>The vail of the first Tabernacle, had Cherubims only on one side of it: and the sockets for the pillars, on which it hung, were Brass.

All, destitute of the single or double portion of Christs spiritual life, which makes vessels of Silver or Gold, will be found vessels of dishonour, or of wood and earth. These vessels of wood and earth, incorrigibly wicked Angels and men, though rendred, by their own fault, vessels of dishonour, the great Lord and Master, of all creatures, in his universal house will make use of them, to his own honour and everlasting praise. This is implied in that interrogatory; <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 21, 23. Of the same universal lump of mystical clay (the immortal beings of Angels and men, in their changable, earthly, first-creation-life, fitly called clay) God makes some vessels to honour, and some to dishonour, in a resurrection of life, or a resurrection of damnation <hi>(Jo.</hi> 5. 29.) a resurrection to everlasting life, and honour, or everlasting death, and contempt; <hi>Dan.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 46. The Lord of this great house, in the exercise of his free grace, powerfully and irresistibly bestows his own creature-life of everlasting righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness on some, which makes them vessels of honour. And, he leaves others to their own choice, in the exercise of their own free-will (whom he has ever seen incorrig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ible in their rebellious mind, against him, to shew his wrath upon, as vessels of dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour.
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:206287:87"/> Hereby will he make his power known, after all his patient bearing with them, during the allotted season of their triall, till they have ripened and fitted themselvs for their own destruction. Thus, as great master of the house, that gives being to all his creatures, will he accordingly make use of them, get praise to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in both his vessels of Gold and Silver, that are saved; and of wood and earth, that everlastingly perish. Those that give not glory to him, by submitting to the terms of receiving his unspeakable mercy, he will take it, in the final triumphs of his justice, over them. Those that honour him, he will put honour upon; and those that despise him, he will irresistibly pour everlasting contempt upon.</p>

                  <p>Heres the use, <hi>Paul</hi> makes of what he had said in the former verse. Saints must purge themselvs from all those things that render men vessels of dishonour, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>festing them to be nothing but wood and earth, that is, to have or regard no other life, but what is a perishing vanity. Out of that state of life, are saints to depart, that has either filth of flesh or spirit, in it. From both these filths, are they to purge themselvs, by quitting that (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 1.) For the Gospel-life, thats, for ever, free from all filthines. They must depart out of their own countrey, or natural state, at best, into the heavenly, new-creation-state or Land of promise, in the image of the second <hi>Adam.</hi> Thus did <hi>Abraham,</hi> in figure and truth. He departed out of the corrupt state of his nature, into the righteous life thereof, figured by litteral <hi>Canaan.</hi> And then, was but as a sojourner there, waiting for the heavenly; <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 13, 16. The fading glory and image of the earthy is to be done away, for the everlasting glory and image of the heavenly; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 10, 11. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15, 49. All first-creation-life in man or Angel, is from the perishable nature of it, charact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by flesh, in which neither of them could ever enter into the kingdom of God. vers. 50. In distinction from this, new-creature, Gospel-life in Christ and his, is called spirit. That that is called flesh, warrs against spirit, in the saint himself, till fully crucified; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. <hi>Paul,</hi> calls the former, at best, a body and law of sin and death, from which the law of the spirit of life, perfectly frees the saint, at last, by the full death of it. So, is the death of death, <hi>Ro.</hi> 8. 2. Where the Gospel-spirit of the Lord is the ruling principle of life and action in man, there is true li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 17.) The free-will of the son of God, the glorious liberty of the adopted sons of God, whom the first born son of God, makes free indeed. This only makes vessels of honour; a life, that has immortality in it. It sanctifies and cleanses from all filth of flesh and spirit, makes them meet for the Masters use, prepared unto every good work. This sanctification by the Gospel-spirit of truth, is, through the death it brings on the spirit of nature, in the corrupt or righteous life thereof. Christ thus, by death sanctified our nature, at best, in himself, and prays that the father would sanctify it so, in his followers; <hi>Jo.</hi> 17. 17. 19. And,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:206287:88"/> all this is but the negative part of everlasting sanctification. The positive, is the set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up of that new life of everlasting righteousness, which will make us holy as God is holy, pure, as Christ is pure; His spirit of everlasting righteousness becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the principle of all our life and action. This compleats our everlasting sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication. The same hand or Gospel-spirit of Christ, that cleares us from all evil, by putting ours to death, fills it with all good, in the gift of its own life. This makes men, every way fit for the Masters use, and ready to every good work. Man never is, or does any thing after Gods own heart, but in Gods own spirit and life. Without the Gospel-spirit of the son, can men do nothing, thats wel-pleasing to the father. In that spirit, and will of God, only, can they possess their vessels, for ever, in sanctification and honour; 1 <hi>Thes.</hi> 4. 3, 4.</p>

                     <hi>Paul,</hi> here, farther admonishes saints, what to flee from, and what to follow after. The negative part of his advice, is, to flee youthfull lusts. He means, not chiefly, the vile affections and lusts of the corrupt spirit of nature, which also are to be fled from; but those, found in the righteous state thereof, when a man is made wise▪ strong and honourable, fruitful and flourishing in the glory and exercise of a first-covenant-life, received in and from Christ himself. The youthfull lusts, incident to this state of man, are an inordinate desire after, love to, and delight in the fad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing riches, wisdom, righteousness, glory and fruits of that life, so as to refuse the death and loss of all, under the cross, for Christs Gospel-life and heavenly treasures thereof, the righteousness and wisdom of God, as the young man did. Vanity is written on all man is, or can do, within the compass of his own nature. And enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God and his spirit of grace, lies under all. So, death is at his door, on all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. The principle and root of all his life and action is vanity▪ His whole fleshly tree with the fruit, root and branch, all is vanity, says the true spiritual preacher, and King <hi>Solomon,</hi> Christ himself. So have we the ground, both of the negative and affirmative part of <hi>Pauls</hi> advice, in these few words, as to what saints should flee, or follow An unlawfull love to the life of the law, inclines to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawfull use of it, against Christs Gospel-life, and so leads towards eternal death. In stead of giving it up in sacrifice to God, by his Gospel-spirit, the setting it up in a rebellious opposition to God and that spirit, was the very sin of the fallen Angels, which has turned them into devils, in unchangable enmity to God. Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full lusts after this life, as also self-confidence in it, will satan back and strengthen by the utmost of his policy and subtleties, and so charm men, as perfectly to deafe their ear to all Gospel-warnings and counsels, as to the vanity and insignificancy of all that to salvation. He deafs self-confident righteous men, to Gospel, more then common sinners. <hi>Publicans and Harlots</hi> are lesse prejudiced against it, then they, and liker to enter the Kingdom of God. An overvaluing thought and unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full love, for a first-covenant life and things of man, therein, runs men into all sorts
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:206287:88"/> of mystical uncleanes and wickedness, against God and his Gospel-spirit, to whom all our love, service and worship should be paid, according to the affirmative part of <hi>Pauls</hi> counsel, here.</p>
                  <q>But follow righteousness, faith, love, peace with them that call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</q>
                  <p>What righteousness? The everlasting righteousness of Christs Gospel-spirit. For this, is the fading, first-covenant-life of our own renewed spirit of nature, with all its perishing vanities, to be fled from; as mystical <hi>Sodom,</hi> if confided in and set up against Gospel light, and life. All is to be quitted as dung and losse, for Christs spiritual life, with <hi>Paul,</hi> which renders man everlastingly blessed in himself, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightfull to God. This, ought man most eagerly to pursue, by an encreasing faith in it, love to it, and peaceful union with Christ, and all spiritual saints, in it, that call on the Lord out of a pure heart. This pure heart, is such as hath Christs spirit of everlasting purity set up in it. In this spirit only, can man acceptably pray, or rightly worship and call on the name of the Lord. This is the only spirit, that can effectually cause man to depart from all iniquity. This only can deliver from every evil way, all the paths of the destroyer. Man is under an absolute impossi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of working righteousness acceptably, bringing forth fruits to God, or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping him in spirit and truth, in the life of his own spirit, at best, that is but letter, figure and shadow of the heavenly.</p>

Such, by which, man contends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christs spiritual light and convictions, bestowed upon him, for keeping up his own nature, in the fading life and glory of the law, thats after his own heart. Such do most vainly contend against the known command of God, and example of Christ, about salvation. Is not this a most vain, sinful, self-destroying labour? The Gospel-spirit speaks nothing but Sword, Fire, War, and Death, to all they dispute for, and contend to keep alive. All questions raised by man, and disputed in favour to themselvs, against the cross, are the foolish, unlearned questions, the disputers of this world do determine, to their own ruine, in flat contradiction to the only possible way and means of their being saved. They maintain the very counsel of the devil, in his mystery of iniquity, against the whole counsel of God, in his mystery of Godliness. The very thing, they question, and strive against, is the whole Gospel-doctrine, and spiritual faith of saints, therein. They most foolishly strive in a known disobedience to God himself, about the way of salvation. This turns their first-covenant life, into a lie. A deceived heart turnes them aside here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto, and they are unwilling to give their understanding fair play, in a diligent sear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the scriptures, with the noble <hi>Bereans,</hi> to see whether things be so, as they
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:206287:89"/> imagine, or no. They will not deliver their soul from satans lie, by asking, Is not this a lie, I carry in my right hand? Will this first-covenant life, indeed, do my work, for salvation? <hi>Esay.</hi> 44. 20. So, they goe on, feeding on Ashes, and Dust, the Old Serpents diet, first-creation vanities. Those that have truly learned Christ, and follow him, under the crosse, raise no such doubts, nor maintain any such unlearned questions and disputes, against it; <hi>Eph.</hi> 4. 20, 25. They put away their lie, and speak his Gospel truth. This will they do, that have heard him, and been taught by him, as the truth is in Jesus. They put off the old man, with all his deceitfull lusts, and false reasonings to maintain them; and put on the new. The renewed old man, usurping all the Gospel titles of the new, thrusts him out of the Church, as a blasphemous wrangler, about the inheritance. Never more generally and prevailingly will this be the practice of the first-covenant brethren against the second, then when Christ is ready to break forth, for the finall decision of the controversy of his true <hi>Sion</hi> saints, against them. These foolish and unlearned questions, and disputes against the Gospel, <hi>Paul</hi> would have saints wholly avoid, as gendring strifes, and contentions, never to be finished, in the principles they goe upon, but by Christs final decision of all controverses against him, at his second com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, in that spirit, they fight against, all along this world, under satans reign. Men stiffly stood up for maintaining their doctrine and way, for salvation, against all Gospel-truth, when Christ himself was the preacher.

                  <p>Here are the qualifications of such servants of the Lord, as are fit teachers of others. They must not strive, but be gentle to all men, patient, and in meekness of
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:206287:89"/> wisdom, apt to instruct even those that oppose themselvs. They are, in the peace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able spirit of Christ, to deal with the unquiet, turbulent spirit of man, striving to the utmost, for the keeping up his own will and wisdom, against Gods; abusing all his natural powers, in contending against God himself. Man sets up his own will and wisdom, in the first-covenant, against the Lords, in the second. True saints are to declare Gospel-truths to such opposers, without any thing of strife, or bitternes, hear, or hear not, waiting on God, for the issue; according to that rule, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 15. The opening hearts, with <hi>Lydias, to receive the truth,</hi> is Christs immediate work, who made that difference in <hi>Pauls</hi> hearers, at <hi>Rome,</hi> where some beleeved the things that were spoken, and some believed them not; <hi>Act.</hi> 28. 24. <hi>Paul may plant and Apollo water,</hi> but unless God <hi>give the blessing</hi> and <hi>encrease,</hi> nothing is done; 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. 6. The words of <hi>Eternal Life,</hi> become a <hi>Savour of Death</hi> to the wilful ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof; yet the declarers of them, <hi>A sweet savour to God,</hi> therein; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 15, 16. His word prospers in the thing whereto it is sent, one way or other, as a savour of life or death, to the obedient receivers, or willful rejecters thereof; <hi>Esay</hi> 55. 11. 'Tis suted to carry on Gods discriminating work every way, as a two-edged Sword, in love or wrath, towards them that are saved, or them that perish. The servant of the Lord, must patiently bear the contradictions of sinners, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant unwearied mind in well-doing, by his own example; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 3. They must not be angry with their hearers, for not presently receiving all they say, however true in itself, or cleerly spoken; but desire them to examine their doctrine, by a right search of the scriptures; <hi>Act.</hi> 17. 11. So, God has the glory, if those that, at present oppose, are brought, by their means, to the acknowledging of the truth. <hi>Paul,</hi> once, remarkably opposed it, himself. The reason, why they should treat op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers, gently, is, because peradventure God will give them repentance to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging of it, according to his own good pleasure. Those that have the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual seed of Gospel-life, in them, whether they be in the corrupt or righteous na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, will at length, receive it, however, at present, in a total ignorance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief of it. Gospel-teachers must rejoyce in a serviceableness to the Lords designs of mercy and grace, towards others, with all patience and long-suffering.</p>
                  <p>The Lord can give them such a repentance or chang to eternal life, as can never be repented of, or turned back again, from. A bare repentance from dead works (or works of the corrupt-spirit of nature, dead in trespasses and sins) to the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous life of the law, with the addition of supernatural, or Gospel-light, may be repented of or turned back from, again, so as to lay men under an impossibility of any repentance or chang of mind, for ever after; <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 1, 6. But, a full repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to eternal life, sets all safe. Then do men awake out of the deep sleep of the spiritual seed in them, and recover themselvs out of the snare of the devil, wherein they were taken alive by him, in the righteous life of their own restor'd nature, which was made by Satans craft, the very Snare, in which he took them captive, at his will. A full establishment of them, there, renders them compleatly, men after his own heart; as the establishing them in the life of the second covenant, would make them men after God's own heart. All men, within the compass of
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:206287:90"/> their own nature, corrupt or righteous, are found by the spirit of God, lying in a union of mind with the spirit of the devil, in direct enmity to God, and that Gospel-spirit, in which alone they can be saved. Satan, as retaining all the excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of his angelical nature, turned into unchangable enmity to God, was too hard for man in innocency; and much more, since the fall. By the superiority of his angelical nature, he can rule over men, in whatever variety of condition, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or reformed, as his captives; yea, as loyal subjects. For, they are in a union of mind with him, their mortal foe, in enmity to Christ, their only deliver, friend, and saviour. As a sore addition to this their dangerous bondage, under satan, it is their will and pleasure to be his captives. They delight to wear his chains, and be caught in his snars. He can gratify man, in all, his heart can wish, in the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt or righteous state, thereof. Man's final deliverance can be, by nothing lesse then the death of that nature, in the life whereof, they are doing satans will and their own, in a union together. In a serviceableness to Gods design, of bringing men to submit to such death, are the teaching servants of the Lord, to endeavour the recovering them out of the snares of the devil. When man is wakened out of the snare of the devil, into the life and glorious liberty of Christ, the fleshly mind, which is satans party, will still keep footing in him, and the spirit of the devil, thereby, maintain a constant fight, against the spirit of Christ, to the last gasp; <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 17. But the spirit of Christ in them, is greater then the spirit of this world, within or without them, and will be sure to overcome; 1 <hi>Jo.</hi> 4. 4.</p>

The Devils reign bears date from the moment of his first sin and fall, by which he set up for himself, in the worldly power of that life, wherein created, in a known rebellion against God and his new-creature-spirit of everlasting righteousness. This did he, in a known contrariety to Christs example (Who, as first-born of all changable first-creation beings and life, the immediate root, womb, parent, head and former of the rest) did by the sacrificing work of his originally unchangable creature-spirit, become the first-born from the dead, in unchangable union therewith. <hi>Col.</hi> 1. 15, 18. The Good angels follow'd this lamb, whither-soever he went, in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to the like mystical death on their changable first-created state of life, in order to passe with him, into the unchangable life of his creature-root and father. <hi>Whithersover he looked, they looked: and whither he went, they went; Ezek.</hi> 1. and 10. In a dutiful compliance with, and obsequiousness to him, their head, when he was lifted up out of the earthly changable life of his Angelical state, by the death and losse thereof, into his own new-creature-state of everlasting righteousness, they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so were lifted up. So, after, was he lifted up, by death, out of the earthly, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able state of our nature, into the same heavenly creature-life and divine also, as a pattern to all his followers, through such death, from amongst men. Evil angels and men, quit this head, refusing to follow him, through such death of changable nature, in the first, into the unchangable life of his heavenly creature-spirit, by a second creation, willfully and presumptuously setting up themselvs in the first, in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable enmity to the second, and so, to, Gods infinite divinity, also. The spirit, or seed of spiritual life, was in the Angelical wheels, that followed him; and so, in men, also; <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1. 20. The same mind was in them, as in their head; and so, in men (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1.) to suffer in the flesh, or changable, first-creation state of both.

Man's establishing himself in the first-covenant, against the second, is of the same dangerous complexion with the sin of Devils; the unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able sin against the holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit. When Satan tempted <hi>Eve</hi> to eat of the forbidden tree, or to gratify, feed, keep up, and establish her self in the first-covenant life, against the second, he told her, that thereby, <hi>They should be as Gods, knowing good and evil; Gen.</hi> 3. 5. This was the highest falshood and blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, imaginable; making it a being like God, to know evil by the doing of it. In this presumptuous God-like soveraignty and uncontrolled exercise of his own will, has Satan been permitted to exercise all the evil that is in his heart, over all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the Earth, or Men, in the corrupt and righteous spirit of nature, as the two branches of his Kingdom. But, in conclusion, all power will be taken from him, and his whole party of evil angels and men. And when this fatal blow draws near, must Saints look for a most perillous season. For, then will this <hi>Dragon</hi> come forth in highest rage, with his utmost depths of subtilty, and methods of delusion, to oppose Christ and his kingdom. He will cause all sorts of iniquity, litteral and mystical, to abound amongst men, beyond whatever was before, to the destroying all foundations of Justice, in any kind, all bonds or ties of Nature, putting men up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on acting against the common light of Reason, and rules of heathen Morality. He will set open the Flood-gates to all sorts of Iniquity, to overwhelm and drown men therein, and fill the whole Earth with Violence and Rapine. And then will he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so prompt and instigate another sort of men, to a yet more dangerous sort of evils, hidden works of darkness, under the guise and cover of spiritual truth and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousness. This use will he make of the first-covenant professour, his choycer and more useful sort of subjects, for opposing the Kingdom of Christ. Then will he, in and by this part of his subjects, speak lies in hypocrisy, or in so near a resem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance to Gospel-truths, as to cause a great apostacy from such Gospel-faith in the spiritual life of Christ, as Gospel-light amounts unto. when this time draws near, for the Man Christs setting open his New-creation Temple, and bringing forth his divine and New-creation Glories, into a general visibility to all, friends &amp; foes, in love or wrath, the devil will first come forth in a most skilful imitation of that new-creature Temple of God, and assert himself, therein to be God, requiring to be worshipped, as so. This, Christ himself has foretold. Devils will come in the appearance of Christs new-name, as false Christs, and transform their false apostles among men, into the likeness of Christs true, to carry on their work, and if possible, <hi>deceive the very elect; Mat.</hi> 24. 24. Nothing of defence, in this case, will be left to Saints, but a steady faith in, and waiting for Christs coming forth in his almighty divine and mighty new-creature power and glories, which will discover and throw off all vizards and disguises, in which false Christs and false Apostles have acted their parts. <hi>For as the lightning shineth out of the Ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This will discover all, and consume the wicked one, with all his crew of false Christs and Apostles; 2 <hi>Thes.</hi> 2. 8. But, immediatly before this final decision, will the greatest falshoods, and highest blasphemies be confidently vented and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, for the very spiritual, Gospel-truths of Christ.

But, when the devil is in his highest rage, opposing Christs kingdom, will Christ, at his comming forth, strike down his; lay all his kingdoms of this world and glory of them, (which he once tempted him by the offer of) in the dust. These practices of devils and men, immediatly before this, would <hi>Paul</hi> have saints, know, look, and provide for.</p>

This, by breaking all bonds and laws, through the unlimited practice of all manner of grosse iniquity, in the most insolent, daring and presumptuous manner, admitting no check or controll, but avowedly glorying in their shame. This will be one ingredient in to these perillous times. But the chief cause of them, will be the mysticall iniquity, that will be the fruit of mens being lovers of themselvs. The self, which the love of, will be the foundation and root of the greatest evils in the last times, is mans nature, as made fruitful in the exercise of a righteous first-covenant life; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, and so, enmity to Christs spiritual life of everlasting righteousness.

The losse of all they glory in, is the undispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble way and means of receiving that life, in which God has all the glory; and they, salvation. All such self-lovers, contradict, blaspheme or speak evil of that spiritual life of Christ, which can be received on no other terms, then the total death and loss of all, they pride and exalt themselvs, in. When covetous, proud boasters,

They do, against their Gospel-conviction, utterly deny there is any such thing, at all. So, make a meer nothing of all Gospel-life, and words thereof. The whole way, life, and words of Christs Gospel, are every where called heresy by them, whereas all their pretended Gospel-doctrine is a meer lump of heresies and blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemies.

The due obedience to Christ, all men owe, is to follow his example and obey his command, in parting with all the life and glory of their own nature, for his more excellent Gospel-life and Glory, never to be done away. He that does not thus follow, obey, and honour the son, as he honoured the father (by the obedient surrender of the life of our nature, at best, in himself) <hi>honours not the Father that sent him (Jo.</hi> 5. 23.) But highly dishonours both, to his own certain ruine.

                  <p>That is, truly good, in Gods sight. Natural affection is the greatest bond and tie in nature, for loving one another, from an oneness of blood and life, therein. And this is a fit type and figure of the yet stronger tie in grace, and union of love to Christ, in his everlasting creature-life, when shewed and offered men. Want of love to him then, herein, is fitly charactred by want of natural affection. For they are under the highest obligation, imaginable, to pay all love, service and obedience to him, therein, by what he has suffered and done, for the bringing them, into it. But then, as a yet worse thing, they are found without any love to him, by being truce-breakers, false accusers, and incontinent. Every of these words signify the greatest unworthines men can be guilty of, in a literal sence, towards men. But, much deeper is mans guilt, in the spiritual sense thereof, towards God. Such, truce-breaking implies they were, once, in covenant with God; not only in the first, by his fresh gift to them of the righteous life thereof, but as convincingly shewed, and offered to be taken into and possessed of the life of the second. By refusing God's declared terms, way and means of partaking thereof, are they truce-breakers. The end of Gods giving the former life, was by their lawful use thereof, in sacrifice, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the latter. The end of the Law is Christ. The end of his giving or restoring the life of the Law, in man's nature, is, that by the obedient use thereof, they may come to him for his Gospel-life of everlasting righteousness. Christ, when he had taken the life of the Law, did exactly observe the terms of translating our nature in himself, into his Gospel-life. And when the like obedience is performed by his followers, all Gods designed ends in both Covenants, are answered by them. On the contrary, all is frustrated by truce-breaking; which is the breach of all obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, man lies under, on all accounts, for obedience to God, and so, for his own true blessedness. If in stead of yielding up the life of the Law, for that of the Gospel, they set up themselves, therein, against the Gospel, they exclude Christ himself, in his Gospel-life, shut up the kingdom of heaven against themselves, refuse so great salvation, offered them, and chuse eternal death. They break all ties and obligations they are under, for yielding to the declared and known terms, of being saved. By owning Christ for a season, in his Gospel-life and truths, by Gospel-light, which is called, <hi>A beginning in the Spirit,</hi> they have been actually engaged, to observe the spiritual Law and Command of God, for the receiving that life, by surrender of their own. The breaking with, and starting aside from God, in this case, with resolution to keep up the life of the Law, and their holy flesh or nature therein, in a fixed enmity to his Gospel-spirit, lodges them in the same most
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:206287:93"/> profane and unholy state, devils are in, think man as well as he will, of it. They break his twofold-covenant with them, by the most wicked use of the former, in rebellion against him and the latter. They do hereby demonstrate, they have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the grace of God, or knowledge of his Gospel-truths, in vain, to worse than no purpose, by unpardonable sinning against all. Christ will have no more to do with them, but in wrath and fiery indignation, and when matters are come to this sad pass, with them, do they become false accusers. They do in utmost malice, think, speak and practice against God, Christ, spiritual saints and all Gospel truths. They accuse, blapheme and decrie all right Gospel-words as the most dangerous errors, and blasphemies, in the world. And this do they, through a mystical incontinency, by running into all spiritual uncleanes, to gratify their idolatrous coveting or lust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing after the first-covenant-life, and fading riches and Glory of their own nature, therein. All this is direct whordom against Christ, in his Gospel-life, and unfaith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness to that mariage-bed, he offered to take them into, with himself, therein. And this spirit of whordom, they are entred into, with the devil, against Christ, renders them fierce despisers of those that are good, true spiritual saints, and all that is good in Gods sight; that is, unchangably good; and so, of all Gospel-truth. They perfectly hate the Gospel-life of Christ, in himself and saints, and all the words thereof. This is the highest wickedness, they can be guilty of. And still, one sin draws on and engages them in another, as linked together, in the same chain. Those that are so fierce, furious, and outragiously mad, against that spirit (in which alone they know, they▪ or any can be saved) and all that have, own, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the words thereof, what will they stick at?

They make their wisdom judg in the case, against all the words of Gods. They unalterably resolve the fulfilling their own will, in a known contrariety to his, in every point. Gods wisdom, words, and will are laid cleer aside and utterly denied. They walk after their own hearts, in every thing. So, not

                  <p>Here is the summ of all, said in the former verses, as to the black and dismal cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the persons, meant; such, as in the form of Godlines deny the power there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. Form of Godliness, here, signifies not a bare, outward hypocritical profession of Godliness, but a real inward principle of it; the renewed principle of first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant holiness. This is but the shadow or image, of the true holiness, or heavenly creature-image of Gods divine holines, in Christs person, called the righteousness of God. Holy flesh, form of Godliness, first-covenant holiness, righteousness of man, though realities, are but fading shadows of the eternall, substantial things and truths of the second, in the heavenly creature-image of God. The law was given by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the life of it was given to man, in the first creation: but, grace and truth, came by Jesus Christ, and are set up in man, by a new creation. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is to be taken down, in order to our receiving the latter, which was first set up in Christ <hi>(Pro.</hi> 8. 22, 23.) But last, in man. The former is called form of Godliness, old<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of letter; the second, power of Godliness and newness of spirit. This latter is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly found in Christs Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousness, and partakers thereof. The first-creation was sown in corruption, not an actual corrupted thing, but corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tible, in all the life and goodness thereof, in Angel or man. Such corruption, cannot inherit incorruption. Nor Angel nor man, in that perishable fleshly life, can enter the kingdom of God; But only as born again of the incorruptible seed of new-creature life. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 23. This is the only creature-life that endures for ever, in head and members; the power of Godliness. All first covenant-life, is but the form. Whoever then takes up therein, for salvation, denies the power, the Gospel-spirit of Christ, in which alone is to be found the true saints Everlasting Rest. All that expect salvation in the form, wil be unutterably disapointed, and found the greatest enemies of the power, which alone gives entrance into the kingdom. The Gospel-spirit is the most mighty, irresistible, powerful thing, next to the almighty and infinite divinity. No first-creation-power can bear up against it, or stand before it. In love or wrath, it will lay all that, flat before it, in all Angels and men; subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all things to it selfe; <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 21. Secondly, then, how come they that are possessed of the form of Godliness, to de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y the power thereof? By an unlawful love to, overvalue of, and false confidence in the former, so as utterly to deny the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latter,
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:206287:94"/> the Gospel-spirit of everlasting life. This, the disciples at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> for a season, and <hi>Paul</hi> himself, once knew not of; <hi>Acts.</hi> 19. 2. On the first glad, Gospel-tydings of it, both he and they received it, and turned from their own un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstanding, conferred not with, or admitted their own wisdom, in the former, judg in the case. But, in a perfect contrariety to this demeanour, others, when clearly convinced of it, by Gospel-light, wilfully reject the whole counsel of God, therein. <hi>The Apostles said, Master, these are hard sayings, who can bear them?</hi> But the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Pharisees</hi> that were before them in light, and discerning, saw the truth of Christ's Gospel-assertions, and blasphemed them. So, were unpardonable blasphemers of the Holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit of truth; <hi>Jo.</hi> 9. 41. They did, knowingly, set up themselves in the form of Godlines, or life of the Law, against the power of it, in the spirit of the Gospel. They denied any righteous creature-life, attainable by man, but what they were possessed of. They clothe that with all the titles or words of scripture, belonging to the second, and so will needs passe for the only Saints. And then will they allow the true Gospel-Saints, no other titles, but apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stats, blasphemers, and the like. So are they hypocrites, in the reality of first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant life and righteousnes of man, as personating what they are not, reckoning themselvs true heirs of the kingdom of God. This self-confident first-covenant generation will not passe away, till all be fulfilled, as to the sufferings of Christ, in his whole mystical body of spiritual saints. Nothing but the actual sound of the seventh trumpet, and acclamations of spiritual saints, at the comming forth of their glorious King, will decide this controversy of <hi>Sion,</hi> against these self-confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent enemies of God and them. Then, all the righteous blood from <hi>Abel,</hi> down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, will be reckoned for, on this <hi>Cainish</hi> generation, from first to last; <hi>Mat.</hi> 23. 35. They set up Christ himself in the flesh, or righteous life of the law, and them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves in a conformity to him, there, in direct opposition to himself and true saints, in his Gospel-spirit of everlasting life. They set up the law, given by <hi>Moses,</hi> in opposition to the grace and truth that comes by Jesus Christ. Their setting up, in the first covenant life of the law, against the second covenant life of the Gospel, amounts to all this. This done, under, and so, against Gospel-light, is the most cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal denial of the power of Godlines, here meant. From such, <hi>Paul</hi> advises all true saints, with <hi>Timothy,</hi> to turn away, as mystical <hi>Sodom,</hi> worse then litteral▪ Christ himself found these wolves in the clothing and titles of the true sheep, the worst of all enemies, and warnes his followers to beware of them; <hi>Mat.</hi> 10. 16, 17. These would needs crucify Christ, when the heathen party would have let him go. Their form of Godliness is the most useful, creditable engine, for oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing and decrying the power thereof. Such carnal-Gospellers, are the most signal obstruction to Gospel, in the whole world. And, accordingly, are to be turned from, by spiritual saints.</p>

All that seek for, and expect salvation, in the <hi>Womanish</hi> principle, where it is never to be found, are the silly mystical Women, here meant. They are, at best, therein, when they reckon all clear and well, laden with sins, and thereby exposed to be led away with divers lusts. In all their first-covenant life and righteousness, there is a filth of spirit, or enmity to God and the second, in which alone they can be saved. This sore disease of enmity to God, is the root of all spiritual uncleaness, in and under the most cleansed, righteous state of man, in the form of Godliness. They are under an impossibility of pleasing God there, because in a spirit of enmity to him. These silly <hi>Women,</hi> even all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, in their naturals, at best, seek help, in that which can never give it.

This done, after Christ has convincingly discovered to them that spirit and life they chuse, to be but a fading flower, and offered his spirit of everlasting life and liberty to them, is the greatest folly, imaginable. For, while they reckon all safe, as cleansed from the common pollutions of the world, in the corrupt spirit of nature, they are guilty of a higher rank of mysticall uncleanesses and spiritual wickednesses, called by the very same names, with the literal; Adultery, Fornication, Idolatry, Murder, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> That very life of the law, in which man is alwayes thus sinning against the Gospel, and God himself, is his sore mystical bondage, and strong captivity. And the lesse perceived, beleeved, considered or suspected, the more dangerous. Thus laden with mystical sins▪ when cleansed from litteral, these evil artists, devils and men come to them, in the form of Godliness, and mystery of iniquity, and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, as laden with sins, easy to be led away with divers lusts, do strengthen and fasten the chains of their captivity upon them, for ever, with themselvs. These silly women are only for the smooth words of false Prophets; endure not the search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words of the true; <hi>Es</hi> 30. 10. Right words of counsell for salvation, are rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned hard sayings, and rejected. They speak death, to all they rest in, for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life. When men dote upon their beautified, adorned nature, in the first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, satan and his instruments, appear their only friends that gratify and sooth them up there, for salvation: Christ, and his true seers, the sorest of all enemies,
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:206287:95"/> that pull down and destroy all that their hearts are set upon, for salvation. But their friendly death-wounds, will be found better then all the others flattering kisses, in conclusion. Christ requires men to hate their own life, at best, that Satan can gratify and please; Else can they not be his disciples. Satan and his instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments creep into the mystical House, even the very hearts and spirits of these silly Women, that please themselvs and love to be pleased and soothed up in the first-covenant principles of nature. So they fall short of the grace and glory of God. They take up their rest in a state, wholly exclusive thereunto. Their creeping into these houses, imports their comming in the most hidden, subtile manner, imaginable, with good words and fair speeches, to deceive these simple Women, by gratifying their belly or natural desires, in direct enmity to the Cross of Christ; <hi>Ro.</hi> 16. 18.

In the spirit of Christ, are they enabled to suffer all things, and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged thereby, to conquer all enemies. God delivers saints not from sufferings, at present; but by them, for ever, as the appointed way of their deliverance. The spirit of Christ, in all times, and most, in the last and worst of times, renders saints, men of contention with the whole Earth, because they torment all that dwell upon Earth, or rest in but earthly, natural principles, corrupt or righteous. All suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of saints, with Christ, as to what is but earthly and mortal, renders them more firm and strong in spiritual life and union with Christ; So far are they from se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perating them from the love of God. By resisting and striving against the enemies of Christ, even to blood or death, rather then comply with their rebellious minds, do they most signally testify against them, that the utmost tribulations are more desireable, then to quit the life and testimony of Christ. In all such sufferings, as men bring upon them, in enmity to the will God, are saints doing the will of God. Who has the best on't? By suffering, they overcome the will of their adversaries, and do the will of God. The will of man, corrupt or righteous, is in union with the devil. The death of that, in order to live in the will of God, or Gospel-spirit of Christ, seperates us, for ever, from the devil, and unites us, for ever, with God. Suffering then, to the utmost, in what can suffer, is the only way to our final de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance.</p>

                  <p>All true Gospel-saints must suffer persecution. True Godlines, in Christ's Gospel-spirit of everlasting righteousnes, inevitably exposes to persecution. Christ himself, on this account, endured the utmost of reproach, contradiction and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>secution, from men. In pure obedience to God, performable only in the spirit of true Godliness, must both the inner and outer man of saints, be exposed to all sorts of afflictions and tribulations, according to the will of God, as their eternal sanctification, from all filth of flesh and spirit. Without such a spiritual circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, as cuts off flesh and blood, the life of nature, at best, which lets and hinders our entrance into the Kingdom of God (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 50.) It is impossible to be saved. This is tormenting doctrine to all that dwel on the earth, or have set up that earthly life of holy flesh, as what they wholly rest in, and build on, for salvation. <hi>Pauls</hi> marks of conformity to Christs death, in his holy flesh, manifested his living Godly, in Christs holy spirit. When saints hate the life of their own nature, at best, as they ought, what an easy yoke and light burden must the Cross of Christ, on all accounts, upon their inner, or outer man, needs be? All is but with design to seize and take from them, what is hateful and burdensome, to him and them, in order to put his desireable yoke and delightful burden, upon them. A perfect captivity or subjection of their will to his, is the glorious liberty of the sons of
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:206287:98"/> God. All, that enemies can do to them, does but hasten the unsinking of them from themselves, by the death of what is in a union of mind with them. The passive part of the true saints Godlines, in obediently following Christs Suffering steps, is the way to his rising up into the greater strength of that life of Christ, which is the Gospel-principle of all true and wel-pleasing active obedience unto God, which is the active part of true Godlines. The losse of that life, in which, at best, we bring forth fruit but to our selves, is our undispensable and only passe, into that newness of life, in which alone we can bring forth fruit unto God All then, that will live Godly in the Gospel-spirit of Christ, must suffer the death of their own spirit, and what God will permit others to do to their bodie, for wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nessing the same things to be suffered by them, in order to their being saved The spirit of true Godlines, in Christ, and the Gospel-testimony thereof, is that which the world will not receive. No Man, in the corrupt or righteous spirit of his own nature, or utmost wisdom thereof, will own, but certainly reject, and be found in opposition to it, as was once <hi>Paul's</hi> own case. There is an absolute necessity then, on all accounts and considerations, from God and Men, friends and foes, that he that will live Godly in Christ Jesus, must suffer persecution. <hi>Paul</hi> would have Saints to expect it from Man, and submit to the will of God, therein.</p>

When <hi>Job</hi> and his three friends were at the end of their line, as to the reach of that first-covenant wisdom and light they were in (as to the debating his case, under the Cross upon all that) <hi>Elihu</hi> comes upon them all, with spiritual wisdom▪ to decide the controversie. He found <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends, wholly mistaken, and himself not a little to seek, though secretly supported by he knew not what, a secret seed of spiritual life, the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changable good thing in him, which God saw. <hi>Elihu,</hi> Christs fore-running messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, unriddles the case, <hi>Job</hi> 32. 37. Then the Lord himself declares the whole my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stery, reason and ground of that amazing dispensation <hi>Elihu</hi> waited for their words; gave ear to their reasonings in their own understandings, while they search<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out words, and said all they had to say. He found <hi>Jobs</hi> three friends had not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swered his words, nor said any thing, that was suited to convince him, nor ever could, in that sort of understanding they went to work, with; <hi>Job</hi> 32. 12. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving silently waited and heard all, they or <hi>Job</hi> could say, in their first-covenant principles and wisdom, which fell short as to the whole matter in debate, he takes the just liberty of shewing them his opinion, and so, the very thoughts and designs of God, as to the dispensation <hi>Job</hi> was under. This new sort of understanding in <hi>Elihu,</hi> put them all into a maze, so that they answered no more, but quite left off speaking; <hi>Vers.</hi> 15. His discourse in another spirit and wisdom, was a meer sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize to the four disputers of this world, in their own wisdom. The issue was, by a silent, quiet hearkening to this new kind of discourse, they were all brought to rights, in the happy conclusion and winding up of all. This is evident in <hi>Job;</hi> and more than probable in his three friends, by what the Lord required both themselves and <hi>Job</hi> to do on their behalf; <hi>Job</hi> 42. 7, 9, They entered this new-covenant with God, by sacrificing the life of the first, in truth and mystery, as well as type, as is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; <hi>Psal.</hi> 50. 5. This did their work, for salvation. Within the compass of natural Objects, if a learned man speak things, obvious and clear to him, before a man of no judgment, as to the principle and foundation of his discourse, tis much one as if he spoke to a tree. The most wise, rational man, is perfectly unreasonable and untreatable, in Gospel-matters, if destitute of faith, or spiritual judgment, suited thereunto.</p>
                  <p>To what purpose can a Man be discoursed, about things, he has no manner of discerning in, but denies all, root and branch? Races the very foundation of all the discourse? If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous Gospel-saints do, or say, but will be denied, by lump? The worldly spirit of Man, in all first-covenant-life, light, wisdom or learning, is willingly deaf'd by Satan, to all right Gospel-words, let any speake or write them, while they will. They that are of he worldly-spirit, in all its variety, and speak of the world, the world run after them, and embrace a smoother in thronged Auditories, out of zeal to their doctrine. They that are of God, and rightly interpret the words of his Gospel, may go seek their hearers, and find next to none. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4. 5, 6. The spirit of Christ only, in himself and saints, can unlock the sealed up Mysteries of Gods mind and will, in the Scriptures. <hi>Peter</hi> joyns in his testimony, with <hi>Paul,</hi> to this truth; 2 <hi>Pet</hi> 1.
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:206287:101"/> 20, 21. If was not the private spirit of Man, in his natural understanding, from which the scriptures came, or by which they can ever be truly interpreted. 'Tis only the publick, infallible spirit of Christ, in himself and saints, by which they were given, that can interpret them. Let this Gospel-spirit and principle of true wisdom, and infallible light (distinct from the fallible light and wisdom of Man or Angel, in the primitive purity of their naturalls) be denied, the Gospel-saint has nothing to say. On this most false <hi>Hypothesis</hi> that there is no distinct kind of creature-life, Man is capable of, from what was set up, by the first-creation in him, all Gospel-doctrine falls to the ground. The gospel-spirit denied, all its openings of hearts and scriptures, is denied. The wisdom of Man will always so interpret the scriptures, as to gratify the will of Man. The scriptures speak death to both that wisdom and will. Saints, in the spirit of God, do truly prophesy or foretell, what will become of all Men, good or bad, accordingly as they fall in with, or are found in opposition thereunto. But, the private spirit and wisdom of Man, passing in swarms of Gospel-teachers and professours, as the only interpreter of the scriptures, the true publick spirit of interpretation, is reckoned a daring, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous spirit, and they that come forth in it, proud affecters of singularity, fools and mad-men; <hi>Hos.</hi> 9. 7, 8. Thus, with <hi>Diotrephes,</hi> does the self-confident private spirit, prate against the true spirit of Prophesie, with malitious words; 3d. Epistle of <hi>John, Vers.</hi> 10. This sort of People said, <hi>Christ himself had a Devil and was mad. Do any of the Rulers, or Pharisees believe or regard his words? A company of ignorant Fisher-men, women, and common sinners, an impertinent sort of frivolous people, these are his hearers;</hi> John 7. 48, 49. But, let Objections against Gospel, carry never such probability and plausible appearance, in a rout of big-look'd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posers; Christs Gospel will carry it, at last, and mans other Gospel (though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so universally, applauded, rewarded, and swallowed down, at random) laid in the dust. Satan is for division, even amongst his own subjects, with their other Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, to busie and keep them in Disputes, and contests one against another, and so all of them from any suspition of his false, or looking after the true Gospel. He embodies them all as one man, against the frightful Cross, Sword, and Fire, Christs Gospel comes upon them all, with.</p>

On this account, Christ commands men to search the Scriptures, in a right waiting on his openings thereof to them. <hi>For these are they that testify of me,</hi> saith

And likewise for the instructing or building Men up, in true and everlasting righteousness.</p>

                     <hi>PAul</hi> gives this great and high charg to <hi>Timothy,</hi> in the name and authority of God and of Christ, the universal judg of quick and dead, at his appearing, and taking to himself his Kingdom. <hi>Paul;</hi> in the spirit of Christ, does here acknowledg the uncompounded divine Essence, or Father; and Christ, in the composition of divine and creature-natures. Hereby is this blessed Mediatour, super-abundantly qualified to be judg of all. In his creature-nature, he is said to be formed out of the Clay, as all below the pure divinity may respectively be called. But hereby is most properly pointed out, changable first-creation nature, as by him transformed into the unchangable state thereof, in personal union with his originall unchangable new-creature nature, and divine. In his divine and various creature-capacities, was Christ fitted, both to create Angels and men, and to mediate between God and them, when created; as also, to fulfil the whole mind of God, towards them, in a state of eternal life or death, as found in unchangable union with, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to that spirit, in which he will judg them all. By the creature-part of his composition, is he what creatures can wish, and God approves, as fitted to trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act all matters between infinite divinity and meer creaturality. This, <hi>Elihu</hi> speaks of himself, as a type of Christ; <hi>Job.</hi> 33. 6. 7. Christ, as son of man, in his spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, kingdom-glory, will judg quick and dead, all men and Angels, good and bad; <hi>Act.</hi> 17 31. <hi>Jo.</hi> 5. 22. 27. This will be, at his second comming, or return from heaven, the far countrey he has carried our nature into, out of its earthly, fleshly state; <hi>Act.</hi> 3. 19, 21. <hi>Luk.</hi> 19. 12. This, the Angels told the disciples; <hi>Act.</hi> 1. 10, 11. And, the same thing▪ Christ himself had told them; <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. 30. He will come in that life, with our nature, to judg the world, that he raised it into, out of the death of that state he first took it in, to suffer. He will appear the second time, with all his saints, in the glory of his spiritual life, discernably to all, both friends and foes. In this state, will he exercise a rule of love over saints, admitting th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="201" facs="tcp:206287:102"/> quick and dead. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 21, 27. Two sorts of mystical dead ones shall hear Christs voice; <hi>Vers.</hi> 28, 29. The dead natural man of the saint, shall be fully rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up into compleat union with him, in his spiritual life. And the incorrigible en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emies of Christ, another sort of mystical dead ones, shall by his all-powerful voice and call, have a resurrection of damnation. All, of both sorts, must appear before his judgment-seat on earth, both the quick, that are sentenced to eternal life, and dead, that will be sentenced to eternal death. This, will this infinite divine and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible creature-judg, do; <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31, 46. He will exactly suit his rewards and punishments to what men have done in the body, or in their natural state, as to the lawful use thereof, in obedient submission to his crosse; or unlawful exalting it in unchangable enmity against him and his cross; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 10.

In the last and most perillous times of this world, will men be found in a more fierce and general opposition, then ever, against the spiritual life, and Gospel-truths of Christ. They will come in the nearest likness thereto, purposely to practice the highest malice against it, for invalidating the whole testimony, and frustrating the whole design thereof. <hi>As wolves in sheeps-clothing,</hi> will they, in the most subtile and dangerous manner, labour to undermine and over-throw that sound Gospel-doctrine and spiritual truth, they cannot endure.

The Apostle, by saying, they will not endure sound doctrine, or Gospel-truth, implies such truth, has dawned upon those that will thus reject and oppose it. And this highly aggravates their guilt, in wilfully crying down, what they can never confute, in any particular.

These seducing teachers, they like, in an irreconcilable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Gods divine and everlasting righteous creature spirit of truth.

So are they found in the most aggravated folly and wickedness, imaginable; a wilful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to what they know to be everlasting truth and righteousness. This great evil will be manifest and more rife, in the last times, than ever, before. They'l re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and embrace, with delight, the very inspirations and doctrines of Devils. They'l call the truly inspired Teachers of Gospel-truth, <hi>Diabolical Enthusiasts,</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:206287:103"/> themselves the only Gospel-Teachers and Hearers. All this do they, to gratify their evil-lusts, and prurient ears.

True saints, in generall, but Gospel-teachers, in a special and extraordinary manner, must look for a full load of reproaches, hardships, and persecutions. They that are of the world, preach up the worldly, earthly, first-covenant life of restored nature, for salvation, and the whole world, all of that spirit and principle, run after them, own, applaud and reward them, as the very Gospel-ministry of Christ.

Ye can never lose it more. <hi>Once, in Christ, and ever in Christ.</hi> Tis your duty to hold it fast, and never let it goe, on any terms. Thus reformation passes currant for regeneration, the renewed old creature, for the new: So, the very regeneration, and new-creature, with all the Gospel-life and words thereof, are shut cleer out of doors. Such teachers hate all that slip out of their fingers, turn their ears from their ministry, to the voice of the true shepherd, and words of his wisdom. But however it fare with the spiritual sheep of Christ, in general; those teaching saints, that are subordinate shepherds, under him, must look for the largest share of serpentine enmity, to be expressed against, and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon them. Yet, is all this but one part of the afflictions of the Gospel, they are to endure, with Christ himself. They must also endure and obediently submit to the death-blowes of the Gospel-spirit, in its cross, or crucifying-work on the spirit of their natural man, as to the best and most righteous restored first-covenant life thereof, as found in enmity to God, and his Gospel-spirit. This spiritual circumcision and fire<hi>-Baptism,</hi> is the greatest and forest hardship of all, to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:206287:104"/> man of the saint. It strikes down the very life of their own will, causes them to cease from the thoughts and reasonings of their own understanding, and so, rest from all natural desire and motion of their own spirit, in the most righteous first-covenant life and wisdom thereof. All expression of malice from devils or man, against them, Christ over-rules into an exact serviceableness to this design of the cross, for bruising their heel, or natural man, to the total death thereof, in order to set up his life in them, in which, to break the serpents head, and trample all enemies, under their feet. In this deepest and sorest affliction, under the cross, must we, with Christ, say, not my will, in the active power and desire thereof, be done; but thine, in the quiet passive obedience of mine, to the death. Had Christ followed the natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral desire of his will, <hi>Let this cup passe,</hi> he had done the very thing, satan, by <hi>Peter,</hi> tempted him, to. This thing shall not be unto thee, <hi>Thou shalt not die at all,</hi> as he said to <hi>Eve,</hi> at first. He was at the same point, with the second <hi>Adam,</hi> by which he gained the first, to his party; <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 22, 23. Such life, finally pitied and spared, brings eternal death, to men: obediently surrendred and lost, eternal-life. Multitudes of Angels and men, chusing rather eternall death, then to part with the life of their humane or Angelical nature, under the Gospel-spirit of the cross, for the everlasting righteous life thereof, and natures sinless offer at such a being spared, in Christs very person shews the extream disgustfulness of the doctrine of the crosse, to nature, at best, which yet is the only undispensable way of being saved. Nature, with all its glory, embellishments, and accomplishments, all its riches, wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and righteousness, must be cut off, and taken cleer out of the first-creation Land of the living, or state of life. Nothing seems more desireable to man then this, to abide in, according to the sight and measure of things, he takes, in his own understanding. 'Tis said of Christ, <hi>Esay</hi> 53. 8. <hi>Who shall declare his gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration? for he was cut off out of the land of the living.</hi> This was a Prophecy, that Christ should be wholly deprived of the exercise and life of his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous natural will or spirit. For, so it pleased the Lord to bruise, and put him to grief <hi>(Vers.</hi> 10) As to leave him nothing of that generation, nothing of the changable life of nature, in him. And the same thing must be submitted to, and experienced by his followers, in order to their regeneration, or birth of a new life in them, transcendently superiour to any thing, man or Angel had in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive innocency of their natural beings. Who then can declare Christs generation, by the immediate divine workman-ship, as the fountain-spirit of all new-creation life, for which he did, and saints must part with all that is natural, in the first? When therefore they are brought to this utmost point of suffering, as the full proof of their love to Christ, they must readily obey his commands, as he, his fathers, for their sakes. <hi>Paul</hi> would have <hi>Timothy,</hi> watch, or provide for all sorts of inward and outward afflictions, under the cross, within; and enemies, without. The patient passing through all, in a passive silence, will be a full proof of his love to Christ, in his spiritual life. <hi>Paul</hi> gladly received Christs sentence of death, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the law of his spiritual crosse, on the righteous life of his own spirit, which is more pungent and grievous to nature, then a thousand violent deaths of the
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:206287:105"/> bodily, sensual part of Man. The Gospel-spirit of the second <hi>Adam,</hi> is the flaming sword that is to pierce thorow the living Soul of the first, in the most restor'd, righteous first-covenant Saint, in holy flesh. This is Gods way, and method of his wisdom, for setting up the life of his living word (that is both the two-edged sword and high Priest of God, that slay's Man) in man. This, <hi>Simeon</hi> saw and said of <hi>Mary</hi> the <hi>Mother</hi> of <hi>Jesus,</hi> that in order to a birth of Christs spiritual life, in her, who was the litteral Mother of his fleshly, the Gospel-sword must pierce thorow her own soul; <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. 35. All these hard sayings to flesh and blood, at best, as to outward and inward afflictions, from God, men and devils, on the natural man of the Saint, must be endured by all true followers of the great Captain of our salvation, who made our nature perfect in his own spiritual al-conquering life, by suffering the death of its fleshly, changable, righteous life of the law. The same Gospel-sword was caused to approach and pierce through the living soul of the son of man in flesh, as through the soul of his litteral mother. This is Gods appointed way, to the man Christ himself, or any of his followers, even manifold tribulations of their natural state, unto death it self, for entrance into his kingdom. As to outward sufferings, how should they scape them? They come with fire and sword, speak nothing but war and death, to all, mans natural heart, at best, is set upon. Can they come thus to sacrifice and offer up that first covenant righteous life of man, (that as set up in opposition to the second, and enmity to its cross, or death-work upon it, is their abomination, and idol of jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lousy) and will not men stone them? To preach death to that, they set up as their God, and salvation, cannot but be a most provoking and tormenting testimony, through their wilful mistake of the design and advantage to them, if obedient. This was typed in the bruitish gods of the <hi>Egyptians, Cows</hi> and <hi>Sheep</hi> the appointed Law-sacrifice to God. Shall we sacrifice the abomination of the <hi>Egyptians,</hi> before their eyes, and will they not stone us? <hi>Exod.</hi> 8. 26.

By sacrificing that which was the <hi>Egyptians</hi> abomination in Gods sight, they must needs do that, which would be, and render them an abomination, in their sight. This, in mystery and truth, will be the case of those that come with fire and sword, on the righteous life of nature, in which self-confidents place all their hopes of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal blessedness.

Apostles were the highest order of Gospel-teachers, which included and comprehended all the inferiour qualifications or measures of Gospel-light or life, in the lower. But evangelists, as a distinct order, prepared People, for the higher ministry of Apostolical teachers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> first preached Gospel to the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and was received by them with great joy; <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 5, 8. This <hi>Philip</hi> was an <hi>Evangelist,</hi> one of the seven Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons; Act. 21. 8. <hi>and</hi> 6. 5. After him, come two eminent <hi>Apostles, Peter and John,</hi> by whose higher and more effectual ministry and prayer, they that had gladly received the tydings of Christs Gospel-life and power, actually received the very life itself, the holy Ghost, or Gospel-spirit; <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 14, 17. In this high service to Christ, and their fellow-mortals, must all ranks and degrees of Gospel-decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, Apostles, Prophets, Evangelists, Pastours and Teachers <hi>(Ephs.</hi> 4. 11.) expect a world of evil, from men, as Christ did, doing all things well, and patiently suffering all manner of evil for so doing, which is the character of the good servant, in mystery and truth; 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 18, 21. Evangelists were assistants also, and fellow-iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerants, to the Apostles. <hi>Timothy</hi> was <hi>Pauls</hi> assistant at <hi>Ephesus,</hi> and left by him, to carry on his Gospel-work, there, in his absence, lest they turn back from Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-light, as the bewitch'd <hi>Galatians</hi> did; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 3. He was to charg his hearers, not to teach, regard, or hear any other, contrary doctrine, for Salvation. The full proof of Gospel-ministers, is a faithful preaching Gospel-truths, and patient enduring the Gospel-cross on their inner Man, or natural spirit, and all sorts of affiictions, oppositions and persecutions, from Men, without, for so doing. For endeavouring to do men the greatest good, they must be content to suffer the utmost evils, God will permit Men to do to them, for their good; even the furtherance of their Gospel-life, by hastning the removal of that which hinders it.</p>

All sorts of outward persecution, from Men, are to be expected and endured, in and for such a ministry. As the full period and conclusion of his sufferings, he declars himself willing to offer up his bodily life, in sacrifice to Christ, as a service to the truth by him preached, and a seal to his faith, in the same.

In this service to his great master, and his fellow-saints, had he a twofold compleat joy and rejoycing, as on these most blessed and profitable accounts, thought worthy to suffer the utmost shame and reproach from men, even to death it self.

                  <p>In the same power or spirit of Christ, <hi>Paul</hi> was delivered from all enemies without, is he assur'd of deliverance from all enemies within, every evil work, and the worker thereof, in him, his natural spirit, in the fleshly mind, will, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire and thought thereof. This is the evil worker, even in saints, while it lives, in its best restored righteousnes. <hi>Paul</hi> himself, in this, had persecuted Gospel. And, after Gospel-conversion, till fully crucified, was it the enemy to his spiritual mind; <hi>Ro.</hi> 7. The fighting down and mortifying it, is the great business of the spiritual warfare, till utterly abolished. The righteous fleshly or carnal mind (that is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God, and death to Men <hi>(Rom.</hi> 8. 6, 7.) If persisted in, and kept up) Exalts it self, with abundantly more confidence, credit, and authority, against God, and his Gospel-spirit, then the corrupt carnal mind or spirit of nature, dead in trespasses and sins. Enmity to Christs Gospel-spirit, did revive, and get up into its vigour, and strength, by the revival of him into the righteous life of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. The first-covenant professour, was, all along, the ring-leader in persecuting Christ and his Gospel. The heathen were drawn in, by them, to assist them, in running down Gospel truths, preachers and professours; that their other, first-cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant Gospel might passe currant with people, for the very doctrine of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. When this carnal foe of the Saints own house, or in his very spirit and person, is crucified, dead and gone, all other foes are blown up. The highest part of the dust of this world, (the serpents food, the invisible glories, wisdom, and righteousnes of the first creation-state of man or angel) when that in us, is dead, that can be tempted or gratified therewith, signifies nothing to us. <hi>David, Paul,</hi> and other Saints have long groaned under the burden of the too oft prevailing acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of their natural mind, in the desire and thought thereof. A perfect death thereof, frees from sin, for ever; <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 7. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4. 1. When the guilty sinner in the Saint, is rightly Sacrificed, slain, and laid in the grave of Christ, there's an end of sin and sinning, for ever. The cross of Christ, on the nature of man, is God's most wise method and way, of delivering man from all his uneasy yok's and heavy burdens. When the natural understanding or eye, at best, is preferred, and fixedly opposed to spiritual light, wisdom, and understanding, then is that eye unchangably evil, and the whole body or man, full of darkness, a perfect hater of all Gospel-light, life, wisdom, and righteousness of God; <hi>Mat.</hi> 6. 23.
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:206287:109"/> Thence-forward, all mans works of righteousness, good words, fair speeches, and discourses (seem they never so good and praise-worthy, to himself or other men) are all wor<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s of darkness, and himself therewith, a loathsome abomination to God; <hi>Luke</hi> 16. 15. Man fondly loves his own spirit of darkness (as to all Gospel things and truths) rather then Christs Gospel-spirit of marvelous light, which his darkness can never receive or comprehend. Men hate Christs Gospel-light, because their deeds, or hidden works of darkness, and all done by them, in the righteous life of the Law, as found in unchangable enmity to the Gospel, will be discovered to be most criminally evil. <hi>Paul</hi> makes it a matter of solemn thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God, that he was in a fair hopefulness and full assurance of a perfect de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from the life and motion of his natural spirit, as a body of sin and death; <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 24, 25. And, so does he here declare, in the exercise of his strong spiritual faith, that he sees certain deliverance from this most dangerous enemy, within him, the evil worker, and every evil work thereof. The fleshly mind, perfectly slain, the spiritual mind in the saint, will enable him to do the will of God, in all things, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any let or interruption. And, as the Lord will deliver <hi>Paul,</hi> by the perfect death of his natural spirit or fleshly mind, from every evil work, for ever, is he sure also, that he will preserve him, unto his heavenly kingdom. <hi>Pauls</hi> conquest and certain preservation, implies not his deliverance from a violent bodily death, but by that, from the visible Lion, <hi>Nero,</hi> as by the perfect death of his whole natural man (body and spirit, too) out of the mouth of the invisible Lion, the devil. Thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, has he nothing left about him, that either of them can ever touch, more. The mortal, first-covenant life of his spirit, expired compleatly with the mortal life of his body; so, was he fully, and for ever delivered from both these Lions, and all enemies, whatsoever. The perfect death of the natural spirit, under the cross, may seem seldom to be experienced by saints, till the death of the body. <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> do seem to have arrived neerest, if not fully at it, while in the body: so, had the translation of their whole persons, into a life of immortality, without seeing death, after the usuall way and <hi>Exit</hi> of other men, out of this world.</p>
